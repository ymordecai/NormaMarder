<i>But the VI chord is unexpected and produces an effect of incompleteness ....It adds suspense and, therefore, interest to the ending.</i><br />
<i>—Murphy and Stringham, Creative Harmony and Musicianship</i><br /><br />

Daddy used to sing while he washed the dishes—his magnificent tenor ringing over running water and plates—wearing a flowered apron with a ruffled bib.  He also cleaned the bathroom, scrubbed the kitchen floor on his hands and knees, and washed the windows.  His agreeableness was frightening, his passion for harmony threatening.  When I was an adolescent I imagined his balls shrinking—I’d seen them, as a kid, through the legs of his boxer shorts.  Aprons and shorts: curtains hiding his secrets.  While Daddy was alive I felt uneasy if Herbert washed the dishes.

I used to say I would never compromise—not as an artist, not as a person—but I have Daddy’s capacity for fooling myself.  After Michael and Yuri were born I dressed up compromise and called it improvisation.  I joked with women about improvising in life, made art out of it, became a specialist, turned it into music and theater.

I look back and say how clever I was, how creative; an artist to the core, able to switch from one medium to another.

I look back and say I didn’t take myself seriously enough.

In 1959 Herbert and I went to Rome.  He studied Italian, I studied Madama Butterfly with a coach from the Rome opera.  I arrived knowing some Italian, of course.  The neighborhood grocer laughed.  My grammar was the equivalent of, “Prithee, wouldst thou present me with four onions.”

	I practiced, took language classes, and worked on “Un Bel Di” with Signor Ricci, a formidable man.  His studio was palatial and dark, perfect for operatic tragedy.  Massive old furniture, heavy velvet drapes, a shawl-covered concert grand.  Signor Ricci implored me to run my vowels together—to suffer like Cio-Cio San, to love like Cio-Cio San, to forget technique.

	Lessons ran late.  We students waited in a narrow anteroom, chatting in fractured languages.  The girls wore fox furs—their toes touched the world—they were performing already in Oslo, in Berlin—the names of cities gave them luster—they criticized von Karajan in casual, world-weary tones.  I felt fraudulent, unworthy.

	Inner or outer, a convenient opposition.  Instinct or reason, conscious or unconscious—which wins?  What’s your purpose, your goal?  I’m going to sing Madama Butterfly.   But when Herbert and I made love on the straw-stuffed letto matrimoniale, I cried out, “I want a baby!  I want a baby!”  And was horrified afterward, as if I’d been invaded by body snatchers.  Who cried out?  Was a jealous self unraveling my knitting while I slept?

	In April, visiting Herbert’s relatives in Israel, I was exhausted and sleepy.  His uncle, a doctor, ran a test and over supper joyfully announced I was pregnant.  I fled to a public garden.  Gray flowers muffled all sounds.  I imagined jumping off a cliff.  I imagined an abortion.  I walked back and forth, staring at gravel.  As dusk turned to night, a delicate scent filled the damp air, the scent of orange blossoms from a distant grove, its complex tones bitter and sweet.  Sweet sensible orange blossoms.  I returned to the brightly lit room where Herbert and his aunt and uncle waited, listening to music.

	Back in New York I held a volume of Proust aloft during pelvic exams.  The clinic interns were impressed.  Actually, I didn’t read a word; my gesture was a protest against smiling babies and adoring moms—all that purity and devotion.  My protective cynicism melted in delivery, of course, as, looking in the overhead mirror, I fell in love with a dark head emerging from my body.  The orange blossom fragrance lingered for years.

	Michael was born in December 1960.  We lived in a semi-heated apartment near 225th Street, overlooking the Harlem River.  The bridge was being repaired at night, blow torches eerie and beautiful.  The apartment was cold, but according to Dr. Spock the baby was due for his first bath.  I set a plastic tub on the kitchen table, turned on the gas burners, and curtained the doorway with a straw mat.  I was an educated mother, I’d taken Red Cross classes.  As the French composer Nadia Boulanger said, “Ven I broom ze floor, I broom it!”—and I was brooming motherhood as carefully as I broomed music.  I remembered the bathe-your-baby class, the soapy rubber doll held like a football, its head nestled in my palm.  I took Michael out of his receiving blanket, dipped my elbow in the water, and slowly lowered him.  He howled and drew up his knees, beating the air with his fists.  The gas jets blazed, the kitchen stayed cold.  I splashed water across his belly and made loving noises.  Alarming brown spots multiplied on his belly and in a few seconds his whole body was mottled.  I took him out and dried him.  No more baths till spring, I said defiantly, and nursed him until he fell asleep.

	Baby-drunk, I stayed home and ate graham crackers.  Keebler Cinnamon Crisps, sweet and crunchy.  Wearing a frayed terrycloth robe, I ate them by the boxful.  It was a kind of madness, a state of nourishment and deprivation.  For months I nursed and ate and when I finally looked at myself naked in the mirror, a roll of fat padded my waist, as if my body had decided to remain pregnant.  I shut my eyes, pretending I hadn’t seen.

	In the spring my friend Joe phoned, telling me I was an idiot, I’d better come back to the Manhattan School.  His voice sounded alien, his words ended in the ear.  I looked down at the snaps of my nursing bra as he went on about auditions and performances.  Did I still care?

	I made an appointment to see the director about my scholarship, hired Dinah as a baby sitter, and set over the buttons on a white skirt with a yellow, orange and black border.  I rode the subway and bus without any scores in my lap.  The garbage cans on East 102nd Street leaned against each other, flute arpeggios leaped through the air.  I felt liberated and ashamed, like a newly released prisoner.

	The students looked alarmingly young.  The dean passed, retraced his steps, put his hands on my shoulders, and looked me up and down.

	 “Looks like you’ve put on weight,” he said, discreet and malicious.

	 “Oh,” I said brightly, “that Italian food.”

	In the director’s office a secretary was typing in a corner.  John Brownlee, formerly a great baritone, sat behind an oak desk, writing with a new yellow pencil.  He looked up as I entered and gestured for me to sit.  I had prepared an account of my year abroad with emphases on opera roles and a projected tour.  I bore greetings from Signor Ricci.  Brownlee leaned his elbows on his desk and held the pencil crossways, rolling it, and stroking the eraser.  He scrutinized me like a doctor.  Three years ago he had praised my audition for opera workshop and playfully tapped my nose with the eraser end of just such a pencil.  The eraser had felt bouncy, like the tip of a tongue.  I had smiled and said in a strangled voice, “Oh, I’m so ambitious.”

	 “I want you to realize something,” Brownlee said, his voice resonant and impersonal.  “You’ve disgraced yourself by having a child.”

	The secretary stopped typing.

	 “You’ve disgraced yourself and wasted our money,” he said coldly.  “You’ve disgraced the school.”

	The room went dark except for the stripes on my skirt and the panel at the back of his desk.  Words floated from his mouth like balloons, bumping my forehead and popping against the fish and eye grain.

	Having delivered his attack, he renewed my scholarship and I took on the tasks of half-time mother and half-time musician.  Dinah cared for Michael every weekday morning and a teenager came Saturdays, a necessity like housing and food.  I took classes and lessons and practiced two hours a day.  Weekends I sang weddings and had various choral jobs.  Herbert taught and worked on his dissertation.  Like Kirsten Flagstad, my upper registers strengthened after childbirth.

	The composer Philip Corner heard me sing a lieder recital on WNYC and asked me to do a piece of his at the Living Theater.  The score was like a drawing.  Notes swam suggestively on the page, attended by ink blots and instructions for dynamics.  The music was improvisatory, asking me to be a composer in the moment of performing, asking me to make space for a line of music to develop as one makes space for a child to grow.

	My teacher said it was crazy.

	 “What do you mean, only three lines on the staff?  You will ruin your voice.”

	She was an elegant Viennese lady, a surrogate mother who joined my parents in expecting me to become a famous soprano.  We enjoyed our labors; she gave me free lessons in the summers.  Her expectations were coercive.  I learned Fiordiligi and Pamina, Schubert and Strauss lieder.  But since Michael’s birth—and since I’d tasted avant-garde music—the old familiar goals, enshrined in my family since the second temple in Jerusalem, were growing dim.  In my teacher’s studio I was split, half of me singing Turandot arias, the other half sliding away, leaving a widening line down the middle which must have appeared as a blank expression.  One day she startled me by suggesting politely that perhaps I should ... had I ever considered ... would I think her rude if she suggested I see a psychologist?

	Increasingly, I sang avant-garde music.  The experimental world was stimulating, I liked the intelligence and fun, the mad/serious personalities, the hard work, the purity of intention.  I performed at the Living Theater, Judson Memorial Church, and the New School; I performed in lofts and festivals, at dance concerts, at Fluxus concerts, and happenings.  David Gordon bit imaginary nails from his arm and spat them out.  Allison Knowles in a state of sublime concentration slowly crawled backward drawing a chalk line on the floor.  La Monte Young played a major third for two days.  Yoko Ono, remote and regal, poured water from glass to glass to glass.

	As a child I used to wake in the night and write melodies, enjoying the constraint—like Beethoven, I thought—of composing by moonlight and deciphering the stuff in the morning.  I wrote poems the same way, scribbling in the dark, the scrawls overlapping.  New music satisfied this impulse to create from scratch.  Starting with a frame—a picture, some squiggles, constellations of dots, calligraphy—I shaped sounds; inventing, improvising, using my voice and imagination in surprising ways—discovering, for instance, the pleasure of being funny.  I often performed with dancers, improvising with bodies and visual patterns.  My voice was an external instrument; it was a string of glass beads, it was water that rose and fell.

	Daddy’s cancer surgery happened just as I was preparing for a major competition.  I cancelled the audition, cancelled everything, and went home to him and Mama until he died.

	After the funeral I threaded his old lieder tape onto the reel-to-reel recorder.  At least his rendition of “Die beiden Grenadiere” was immortal.  The opening piano chords sounded, then his beautiful voice singing the first line, “Nach Frankreich zogen zwei....”   The phrase broke.  A microphone crackled.  A hideous drone came off the tape, a monotonous chanting in Hebrew.  I seized the box.  Penciled lightly under the original contents were the names of boys—the tape was filled with bar mitzvah lessons for his students.  In despair I played it anyway.  Magnificent bursts of Schumann erupted, then dry prayers circulated, like crickets.

	I never went back to school.  I left my teacher without saying goodbye, and my aspirations for a career in classical music slipped into Daddy’s grave.  Was all that work anchored by a deep-seated obligation?  Had I been doing what he expected?  Identifying with him?  Carrying on a two-thousand-year-old family tradition of singers in the temple?  Whatever the incentives, the mantle of high priestess slipped away.  The father portion of my creative self, the voice, took a back seat to the mother portion, the artist.  I concentrated on performances at hand and lived with nuggets of shame and self-hatred.  Leaving my teacher without a word was rude and ungrateful, but I’m afraid my father’s death was all I could bear.


Compromise became ordinary; life was feathering, accommodating interruptions, making collages.  One day Philip Corner asked me, “What’s the difference between artists and normal people?”  “The child stays alive in us,” I replied.  Patterns of constraint and freedom were popping up everywhere—in toilet training, in Bach, in Ives.

	Ives was a revelation, a composer whose words didn’t distort my emotions.  Women, after all, sing men’s music.  We’re emotional conduits for their deepest, most suspect feelings about us; we take on their knowledge, but not their power.  It’s subtle torture.  But Ives’s subjects were non-coercive.  I could find them in myself—exile, sons dying in war, the persistence of memory, the rule of nature.  He had a keen, wry fondness for chaos; his tonal shifts, jagged rhythms, and melodic leaps were more timely than Schubert’s romantic order and he certainly didn’t moon over a miller’s daughter.  During my recital of Ives songs in McMillan Theatre the windows were open and a band was playing outside.  The sounds of Columbia University’s Spring Carnival and the sounds of Ives “collided with about equal intensity” in the ears of The New York Times reviewer, amusing him immensely.

	A year later I was pregnant again.  Michael, age three, conducted a piece at the New School and I sang on the same concert, the baby inside swimming back and forth.  I was holding music and family together, thumbing my nose at John Brownlee.  Around the time Herbert interviewed at the University of Illinois, our second child, Yuri, stood in his crib and sang the last notes of my vocalizes.

	Herbert accepted a job at Illinois; we would leave New York.  I couldn’t say, “Let’s not go, I’ll earn tons of money and support the family.”  I didn’t tour.  Many musician-mothers did, had the necessary ruthlessness and confidence, could harden themselves to the dimming in a toddler’s eyes after a long absence, but, having seen it once, I vowed never again.

On my final concert that season I sang John Cage’s dramatic satire, “Aria,” not knowing he was in the audience.

	Cage came backstage.  “How could you do it perfectly?  We’ve never met,” he said, smiling with mischievous innocence.

	 “I never met Bach, either,” I replied.

	The meeting was heady.  I stood at the world’s door and felt again that twinge of dishonesty, of unworthiness.  I wanted to laugh, but pretended to be adult, and we discussed managing a career from Illinois.

	The previous year a choreographer from the Judson Dance Theater had married a physicist and vanished.  Dancers and musicians were shocked.  Where did she go?  Some wasteland between New York and California, we heard.  What would she do there?  It was as if she had died.  Now it was my turn.  There was a big goodbye party at pianist Jim Tenney’s loft.  I wandered among friends and colleagues, dancing a little, eating a little, feeling as miserable as an overgrown hermit crab.  My professional self lay in the sand, an empty shell, while I crawled away, waving frantically.

	All this was a soft counterpoint to the hard, dreadful theme of life.  Michael’s navel had never closed up—an umbilical sinus, according to the pediatric surgeons—and before we left New York he would need abdominal surgery.  The night before the operation we took him to the pediatric ward of Babies’ Hospital.  A hideous rule forbade parents to stay overnight.  We played with Michael our allotted hour and then prepared to abandon him, our four-year-old, sitting on the floor among toys.  Nearby a little girl with one leg and no fingers sat in a wagon.  Michael set his lips and added a block to his tower; he became old.  Go, he said.  The surgery was long and deep.  When we next saw him he was a white figure kneeling in a white crib.  No comfort comforted him.  He couldn’t even cry.  He suffered, his eyes wide and betrayed.
	The photos from that summer, on Fire Island, show Yuri crowing with delight and Michael looking inward.  His interior wound healed slowly; little black silk threads wormed their way out of the scar.

We arrived in Champaign bewildered but fairly optimistic, like immigrants in a strange country.  The land was flat and we lived in a green cracker-box in a neighborhood without sidewalks.  There was no public transport and I didn’t know how to drive.  Park Haven Drive was quiet as a cemetery; houses held women and children by day, whole families by night.  Lights went on and off, cars went in and out of driveways.  Michael, formerly cheerful and outgoing, sat stoically at the edge of our front lawn, waiting for children to come over.  Yuri screamed in the nights.  “Dislocation sickness,” the pediatrician said—we all had dislocation sickness.  At our back fence horses grazed in a field we called the dirt piles.  Were they imprisoned, or were we?  I practiced daily.  For what?  I grew fatter.  Later I called it my Ozark year, referring to Dorothea Lange’s photographs of rural Depression women with sagging jaws and sad eyes.
	In the spring, when I was starting to get work and had organized the children’s lives, the Creative Arts Center at the University of Buffalo asked me to apply for the post of singer-in-residence.  A grand opportunity, awkwardly timed.  Would the job be deliverance, I asked, or a fabulous torment?  I stood in Frost’s yellow wood, looking down two diverging roads, almost glimpsing my shadow self, the ideal self whom others believed in, choosing a path.

	The Swiss psychologist Alice Miller says children who are gods to their parents, who grow up solving their own problems with no adults to intervene, grow up contemptuous of weakness in others and blind to weakness in themselves.  Nominally despised in elementary school for being Jewish, my chief crime was being different—tall and smart, wearing orthopedic shoes, eating prunes and raisins at recess.  Like Elaine Risely, in Margaret Atwood’s Cat’s Eye, I couldn’t be what the other children valued, so I made a virtue of being an outcast, grew strong by keeping silent, turned alienation into originality.  A little adversity is beneficial, I said, an antidote to adoration at home.  I masked myself in cleverness, in goodness, in success.  But inside, so deep I didn’t hear them, the shrill voices of little girls were taking root, growing virulent: “Hitler’s a Jew,” one of them screamed, “killing all the Christians in Europe!”

	I had turned their judgment inward—so it seems in retrospect—and when I became a mother it rose up against me.  Invited to Buffalo, offered a chance to advance professionally, I saw nothing but failure.  There were knots inside me tight as the knots my father tied on boxes.  I was a responsible mother, I had a traditional marriage, and, lacking perfect pitch, I learned atonal music slowly.  What would I do when the kids got sick?  I visualized a small room.  The children lie in beds with the flu.  There’s a difficult score on the piano.  My husband is out teaching.

Bombs exploded and sirens wailed.

	The people in Buffalo were sorry I wasn’t free to come and asked if I would do a premiere for them.  You see? I gloated, I don’t have to uproot myself.  And then the score arrived.  Normally one asks about the tessitura of a piece in advance—how high does it sit, how low—one never agrees to sing a work without asking if it’s in one’s range.  The nasty little girls—how they shrieked: the music, revolving around high C, was for lyric coloratura.  Snowballs flew; I crouched and covered my face while the entire class jeered, girls making snowballs as fast as the boys could throw them, my lower lip swollen but sucked in.  The New York scene closed.

	A new friend understood all my moaning and groaning, the vanished dancer/choreographer from Judson, Ruth Emerson, who miraculously appeared at a campus happening, roller skating through skeins of toilet paper.  Astonished at the sameness of our exile, we moaned and groaned together, juggling art and domestic life, which was as hard as balancing on one foot.  In Ruth’s words, we wanted to go into a room and close the door, but we had to get dinner on the table.  I think we were cursed with hyperactive consciences—we felt guilty about being artists.  Perhaps what we meant when we said we wanted to put down roots is that we wanted to belong in the community where our children were growing up and sometimes we even thought we’d succeeded.  Ruth and other dancers formed a company.  We collaborated as we had at Judson.  She taught dance, I taught voice.  We sustained each other on stage and in our houses, in sickness and in health, cared for each other’s husbands and children, cooked Thanksgiving dinners, organized conferences, sewed beautiful garments, and worried about growing old.  At times we saw ourselves as reluctant pioneers in the dispersal of the New York avant-garde, but both of us knew we would have been more popular at dinner parties if we were biochemists.


Culture in Champaign/Urbana, monopolized by the university, was generally classical and tame.  Some of us had visions of a community arts center where new ideas could flourish.  A group from the English department rented the old Urbana railroad station, a brick, pagoda-like structure between the tracks north of Main Street on Broadway—a good space, with marvelous acoustics.  The only drawback was an occasional passing freight train.  Some of the original board members, like Herbert, were interested in experimental drama, others were interested in film and art exhibits.  With donated materials and modest financial contributions, we renovated the interior and built a small theatre.  On a whitewashed rectangle the name, the Depot, was lettered in black enamel, a humble sign, appropriate for the neighborhood.

	Our intentions, however, were not humble.  We were creating nothing less than the Abbey Theatre in Dublin—a place for town and gown to spark a cultural renaissance.  As publicity director, I wrote the gospel, proclaiming, “People will exchange ideas, not only about the arts, but about the society in which we live and the problems of our own community.”

	At our open house two hundred people came out of the woodwork, signed a list, and offered their services.  The newspapers were friendly.  “Hearts and flowers,” said an editorial, “to the new center for artistic experimentation begun by local individuals.”  We opened with Beckett’s Endgame, followed in the same month by a multi-media show and The House of Bernarda Alba.  Actors washed toilets in the morning, painted sets in the afternoon, and performed at night.  University graphic designers made posters that were works of art.  I taught myself to write tamper-proof press releases. Doing publicity, like performing, was an act of seduction.  I loved the rough intimacy of cramped newspaper offices, an esoteric pleasure, like taking routes through back alleys.

	Structurally, the Depot consisted of several autonomous groups who performed regularly and made a village-like community.  Michael and Yuri grew up taking tickets, sweeping the floor, and designing flyers for Saturday morning children’s films.  Herbert wrote poetry there, sitting cross-legged on the empty stage, dictating into a tape recorder.  I acted in plays, sang concerts, and produced music and dance events.  We did Pinter, Soyinka, and Shakespeare; Lorca and Mednick.  Martin Duberman’s In White America brought people from the black community and launched the career of the late Tony award-winning actress, Lynne Thigpen.

	Over time, of course, our ambitions narrowed: sightlines were terrible for films, offset printing was expensive, and children didn’t show up on Saturday mornings.  A thief broke into the lobby during a photography show and stole four photos of nude women, putting an end to art exhibits.  We settled for plays plus occasional dance and music concerts.  Some productions prospered, some failed.  We were the theatrical underground—anarchic, schizophrenic, tenacious; sometimes bursting with energy and ideas, sometimes moribund.  I loved it the way I love people and beautiful places.

	When the Depot became stable, Herbert left the board and formed an experimental group to improvise with words, like jazz.  Three grad students and a social worker met at our house one Sunday night.  Sitting on our living room floor, we started weaving a story in which a woman came down an ivy-covered staircase, smelling something burning.  Where could we go with that?  We recorded our separate narratives on one of my practice tapes and the erase head malfunctioned, making an aural double exposure of stories and Mozart arias, a collage of interruptions and juxtapositions.

Accident became our guide.  We received a grant for professional equipment and recorded ourselves talking simultaneously.  Simultaneity liberated us, took us into and out of ourselves. There were six of us, with different professions and wildly different personalities.  We did voice exercises and mental exercises.  Collective ideas and emotions tumbled us about; we quickly discovered our habits.  I often told entire plots as a basso ostinato, someone else repeated a few words, a reserved woman emoted intensely, another asked irrelevant questions.  As Salmon Rushdie said in a terrifying context, “Our lives teach us who we are.”

	We named ourselves New Verbal Workshop, called our idiom speechmusic, and performed regularly at the Depot and the University.  We composed formal, dramatic pieces out of quarrels, laughter, chants, cries, songs—any sound the voice could make.  Performing was dangerous.  We used no scores.  The subject and shape of each piece was fixed, but language and emotions evolved in the moment.  We called this “hard” improvisation.

	 “Gothic” was three duets about childhood nightmares, performed in the dark with one candle, the last movement primal screams.  In “Lies” we sat on stage back to back, like spokes of a wheel, and slowly, quietly told lies, first about ourselves and then about our mothers.  “Ante-axis,” a collaboration with Ruth and her dance company, was a comic piece based on missed signals and fleeting interactions—Ruth’s theme in art and life.

	A Chicago Tribune reviewer wrote, “At times the sextet resembles an encounter group of uninhibited schizophrenics....  In fact they are as serious and disciplined as the Bob Schiff jazz trio.”  A composer wrote, “Here is a group which has been doing group composition for years, doesn’t treat it like an end in itself, and yet has lost none of the direction which is usually thought possible only when a single mind has given the plan of operation.”

Our tapes were played at festivals of new music.  We performed Ken Gaburo’s “Maledetto,” and recorded Ben Johnston’s “Visions and Spels.”

Every Sunday evening for ten years (except summers) we sat on the living room floor, connected and solitary, sharing an esoteric, impersonal knowledge of each other through our fantasies.  We knew who stalked an ice jungle, who ate Moon Pies, and whose mother wore combat boots.  Speaking simultaneously we liberated ourselves from thinking; we focused on structures and our places in them, playing with words which arrived on their own.

Years later I asked Yuri, a photographer and web designer, “What did the Workshop mean to you, lying up there in bed, hearing weird sounds every Sunday night for most of your childhood?”

	 “It was an intensely atmospheric part of growing up,” he said.  “It added to the longing and anxiety that a child has on Sunday night, that monolithic Sunday night—you know, not wanting it to end and knowing that inevitably it will end—all those mixed emotions a kid has about Sunday night. I listened for things you and Dad might say, things that adults talk about—it was voyeuristic—things about sex and violence.  And the other things had a rhythm to them and were soothing.  It all existed—like the stuff you sang—and it was part of the whole environment.”

	I asked Michael, a physicist and violinist, what he remembers.

	 “I was used to hearing weird music anyway,” he said, “so I wasn’t surprised by it.  I remember the concerts better than the Sunday evenings, especially ‘Midget Mass,’ with Dad sitting in the middle of a group of people looking exceedingly earnest.  You didn’t gel into finished pieces until you had a concert coming up—the main difference is on Sunday nights there wasn’t usually much energy going through from beginning to end, whereas on a concert you maintained the energy nonstop.  As for my feelings about the group—I’m not sure I trusted the people, they seemed a little unreliable.  It’s peculiar, given all this, that I’ve ended up with the most conservative musical taste.”

	 “Did you learn anything from Workshop?” I asked.

	 “Sure ... how to sleep through anything.”


I thought the Depot would go on forever and I would have been content if it had.  But the scene had already changed invisibly when I asked one of the directors, a florist, how to make my pineapple plant flower.  He was a secretive man who controlled by withholding information.  He never criticized one actor in front of another; he used silence as a weapon.  He was a good director, though, and knowledgeable about plants.  We were on our way to Chicago to perform Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris, riding in a van, and he said the trick was to set an apple on the new leaves and let it rot there.  From the front of the van someone said, “Everybody in Chicago is happy because Chicago sits on high-energy granite.”  When we returned, the director calmly announced he had bought the Depot building.  He was going to be in charge, have his own company, be more professional.  We could be tenants or get out.  The board was shocked.  How can you betray friends? we asked him.  He sat in a chair like a captured soldier: legs crossed, head down, reciting his name, rank, and serial number.

	My anger, my bafflement, my panic had no outlet—I say “my,” but it was collective because we were all divorced, all betrayed.  I wrote an article for the papers.  We were interviewed, he was interviewed, we consulted a lawyer.  A ripple in the public consciousness swelled and subsided.  My only weapon against him was the one he used against others, silence.  Meanwhile we examined every large vacant space in town; they form a tunnel of shifting expectations—narrow, acoustically dead, expensive: church, Masonic Hall, warehouse, ballroom.

	On a long snowy day in February the Depot was parceled out to basements and garages.  We stripped the building of everything we legally owned—the contents and the name.  Black-humored mourners were witty and inventive; we would have ripped out the furnace if we’d had the tools.  In a rage, the treasurer smeared the outdoor sign with ragged streaks of black enamel, a frenzied Franz Klein of torn limbs dripping black blood.  Our grief exposed, a wild, raw-throated howl of pain in the neighborhood, certain to satisfy the enemy.  That evening, in a fine, dry snow, I poured white paint into a tray thick with accumulated colors, set the tray on a ladder and climbed up with a crusty old roller.  A freight train passed—the sort that had often thundered through delicate scenes, shaking the walls while actors froze.  I waved at a man in the caboose; he waved back.  Then I furiously rolled paint over the tenacious black enamel until the sign was dirty white.

The Depot scattered and took root elsewhere: Fresnel lights shone in a high school, actors shone in Hollywood.  The loss gnawed at me.  As for the pineapple plant, it stopped growing.  It didn’t die, it just never grew again.  For three years it stood in the bathroom absorbing sunlight and water, arrested like a graceful corpse, its narrow leaves still bowing from a central stalk, its head a crest of stunted spears.  The leaves had lost their shine, becoming surly and khaki-colored.  One February morning, noting that it was the third anniversary of the Depot’s demise, I set the plant outside in the snow between the arbor vitae and the fence.  It reproached me every day.  By April it turned brown and was raked up with old locust pods.


For years afterward my life seemed one long piece by John Cage, governed by a “purposeful purposelessness or a purposeless play.”  I taught voice.  It brought in money; it was useful and satisfying; I did it well.  My students loved me.  I loved them.  But I was eaten away; that which sang was dying.  Several concerts a year, new music and classical, some touring.  I taught literature to old people and served on committees.  I made needlework tapestries in the summers.

	I began writing during the first years in Illinois when singing jobs were scarce.  Writing was, at least, an independent art.  Mostly I wrote in the summers, but when we moved out of the cracker-box into a large old house I set up a typing table in the dining room, watching squirrels run up and down the locust tree.  I wrote very short things, one page long.  I saw images and took down what I saw.  A woman heaves herself out of a bog.  A man is suffocated by a swarm of dandelion puffs.  An old woman paints circles on stones.  A hand-shaped cloud blocks the sun.  A woman’s bloody head is carried around a frozen lake, dripping on the ice.  A man and woman make sculptures out of melted plastic forks.

By 1979 I was writing longer pieces.  Would writing be salvation?  Would a new art grow from the ashes?  A sharp pain stabbed the back of my neck; singing had literally become a pain in the neck.  Patience, I said, I am a patient person.  I accepted the truth about myself, hard won, that as a musician I’d operated within the limits of my responsibilities as well as the limits set by my demons.  Our sons were interesting young men.  Every morning I was happy to see Herbert’s face on the other side of the bed.  So many people have nothing, are deprived of food for body and spirit; I had no right to complain.  But I was unhappy—part of me was unhappy.  Part was happy.  Sometimes one was ascendant, sometimes the other.  Passing for confident, I had a vein of self-criticism so huge I heard my voice only in extremes, either perfect or flawed, mainly flawed, my insecurity as huge as my arrogance.  I wanted to fly, but where and how?  I wanted to do something dangerous, confront fears of loss and change.  Make art that didn’t depend on the phone ringing.  Michael was in college.  Herbert, Yuri, and I were about to go to England for a year and live in a village.  What choices would catch up with me there?

	Around the corner, around the bend—there, by the tracks, a piece of paper.  Pick it up.  Read it.  Act.  A train coming, slowing, the huge engine breathing beside me.  When I was a child my mother walked in front of an approaching train.  Sure of immortality and her judgment of distance, Mama crossed the tracks while I hid my eyes on the crossing-gate.  The train passed and Mama called from the other side, “See, I told you.”  What would this train do?  I wanted to go into the image and beyond, to make art from scratch, to write something long.  About a child who’s afraid of holes in the floor and stops talking.  About a woman whose credit in life is having slept with Paul McCartney’s assistant press secretary.

	I folded the paper and put it in my pocket.  The train moved on.  I stood in the tall grass and looked across the sea.
