Everybody says she’s crazy—a woman thirty-five and not married.  Men get called crazy from how they act, but a woman just has to be single.

Plenty opportunities she threw away.  Walter, a baritone—everybody says she should have married Walter, she wouldn’t have stomach aches.  Sure-sure.  The closer Lillian got to saying yes, the older she felt.  Three years she kissed him and listened to his opinions—heaviness closing around and squeezing like a waistband, imagining a lifetime with him, a lifetime of accommodating—she always has to accommodate—a tiny bedroom, drawers full to the brim, jewelry and makeup tangled up in cookie tins, seeing only half herself in the mirror.

She makes the best of it, keeps busy.  Helps Mama around the house.  Shops.  Tries on outfits.  Acts out songs in the mirror—“Stormy Weather,” the “Habanera” from Carmen.  She’s a contralto.   Her chest tones are gorgeous.

It takes work, keeping up her voice and her looks.  Everybody says she’s beautiful, a combination Marlene Dietrich and Greta Garbo.

But they don’t know her—not her sisters, always trying to change her, making a fog between her and the world.  In Sierpc she could see through the fog, but it got thicker in America and only noise gets through.  Windows slamming in the courtyard, washline pulleys squealing, mothers hollering at kids, couples tearing each other to pieces.

She dreams of her own place, her own kitchen, making soup.  Mama doesn’t let her cook and, to tell the truth, she doesn’t know how.  Children?  Probably too late.  Luckily she has Regina’s Howie, the light of her life, so sweet and chubby she could eat him up—in third grade already.

Gladys’s Sarah never took to her—Miss Know-It-All.  Sylvia’s baby throws up on her.

The phone is a serious matter, on a little table under her window, by her pillow.  She gets nervous when it rings—you never know, maybe something wonderful will happen.  But it’s usually her friend Tanya saying we’re getting together.  They eat, they sing—Gladys and Sam join in when they come to Brooklyn.  Gladys is a soprano and Sam is a tenor, like Caruso.  A sweet man—naturally Gladys got him, being the oldest.  Regina and Sylvia snapped up their first opportunities, just to get out of the house.  Big mistakes.  Mama nags her for throwing away men—a shame, she cries, shaking her hands at God, such good dressers, such good providers, so intelligent.

It gives her stomach aches.

Which is why she didn’t pursue music.  She could have been a great opera singer—everybody says her voice compares with Marian Anderson—she doesn’t even need lessons.  But a voice isn’t everything, you need good health and, above all, connections.  So she limits herself to social functions.  “Golden Earrings” always makes a hit.  She feels the words and it shows off her chest tones.  Everybody compliments her chest tones.

<i>So be my gypsy<br />
Make love your guiding light <br />
And let that pair of Golden Earrings <br />
Cast their spell tonight. </i><br /><br />
<p><center>§</center></p>

April, 1948.  Help was the latest word.  Doctors gave treatment.  Psychologists gave help.  Regina said Lillian’s stomach aches came from finding fault with men.  Gladys said finding fault gave her excuses to say no.  Sylvia said finding fault made her feel big.

Lillian acknowledged her sisters’ expertise.  “I have to give credit where credit is due,” she said.

Regina arranged a consultation at a Long Island mental hospital with a residential therapy program for low-income people who weren’t really crazy.  Izzy drove them in his laundry truck.  Regina sat up front and Lillian sat in back on a tire with Howie.  Izzy pressed the accelerator, released the accelerator, coasting every three seconds.  Lillian sat hunched over, hugging herself.  His driving resembled a stubborn case of hiccups.

Regina slapped Izzy’s arm.  “Why don’t you drive like normal people?” she said.

“It saves gas,” Izzy said, coasting.

“It’s making Lillian sick,” Regina said.

“Everything makes Lillian sick,” Izzy laughed, lifting his foot.

Lillian made a good impression on the psychologists and was admitted for three months.

<p><center>§</center></p>

Her doctor is a sweet young man.  He teaches her a new language.  Neurotic.  Introvert and extrovert.  Complexes.  She was born sensitive, so poverty and war made her neurotic.  Regina was born happy-go-lucky so she copes.  Gladys had no childhood so she’s insecure.  Sylvia was born afraid of everything.  What’s done is done—she’s sure that’s what the doctor means.

Regina says, “You need to get fixed.  What are you here for, anyway?”

“To understand myself,” she says tolerantly.

She learns her childhood is so important the doctor writes down every word.  She says after Papa left Sierpc they lived sixteen years with relatives, crowded in two rooms.  Bombs fell; dogs barked; soldiers ran in the streets.  She was always hungry, always needed an extra piece of bread, another mouthful of soup.  She tore off dresses Mama fixed over and banged her head against the wall.  Her sisters called her the green one, the snake, and laughed when she prayed in the closet.  When Papa settled in America and sent for them, she dreamed about the goldeneh medineh where people were so rich coins lay in the street for the blind to pick up.  But it was a top floor tenement and work in a dress factory.  Papa turned out to be nervous and angry.  He pinched her bottom and touched her breasts.

The doctor keeps bringing that up.  He wants to know if it happened to her sisters.  She says they never talk about such things.

When’s the last time he touched you? he asks.

She regrets having mentioned it.

Does your father find you attractive? he asks.

To tell you the truth, she says, being beautiful is no picnic.

Does he really want you to get married?

Nobody was good enough for him, she says, only Gladys’s Sam—Regina and Sylvia got married irregardless.

How do you feel about that now? he asks.

Mixed up, she says.

The doctor takes a big interest in Papa’s habits.  He’s a bass, she says, like Chaliapin.  He sits in the kitchen and sings a few lines from “Meadowlands,” holds a low tone, then a piece of “Ol’ Man River,” another low tone, another piece, another low tone.  No respect for music.  When he comes home from work he picks fights over some little nothing.  She screams, he hollers.  He’s not a happy man.  Something eats him inside.

She comes home after six months, her stomach much improved, her feelings rearranged.  But she feels upside down with everybody from knowing too much.  Gladys has an inferiority complex and Sam cares so much for approval he lets people step on him.  Regina has a superiority complex so she married Izzy who needs help.  Sylvia is an introvert who doesn’t mind Leon dominating her.  Papa dominates Mama who’s weak-willed.  After a while she gets acclimated and gives help and everybody is impressed she learned so much in a short time.  You have a good head for psychology, they say.

 “I know people,” she says mysteriously.  “I can see right through them.”
But she can’t manage to see through herself.  Words don’t give her a handle on her condition; she feels bottled-up.  All she wants to do is shop and that doesn’t satisfy for long.
<p><center>§</center></p>

November, 1948.  Her heels caught on a grate; heat blasted up to her underpants.  Inside, crowds of women ransacked clothing bins, greedy as wild animals.  She had a friend who yanked buttons off or made holes with safety pins, then demanded reductions for damaged merchandise.

She liked shopping in Ohrbach’s.  In Manhattan on her own, hunting for bargains, trying on clothes.  In budget sportswear she picked out three black corduroy skirts, special buys.

The dressing room got redesigned while she was away—no curtains anymore.  Terrible, making shoppers feel like robbers.  All because of a few cheaters.  She tried on the skirts, feeling guilty for nothing.  The black flare was perfect—she looked sideways in the mirror, arms raised, holding her breath—a little snug, but it had a very slimming effect and if it shrank she could always use a safety pin.

At checkout the girl folded her bag twice and firmly stapled it.  Maybe there’s new management.  She caught the girl’s eyes and smiled.

Escalators didn’t go to the bargain basement—you walked to rock bottom reductions.  Bare bulbs cast harsh shadows.  Women and old men scavenged through bins of damaged or past-season clothes.  You tried on garments over your clothes, fighting for your rights at narrow mirrors.  Smart shoppers like her put up with hardship.  Her friend Manya, a camp survivor, got depressed sometimes and spent whole days in the bargain basement.

She squeezed into the crowd around a bin of irregular lambswool turtlenecks.  Sweaters flew from hand to hand; the pile heaved.  The thirty-eights were all pastels, but she found a purple thirty-six, only one small rip in a side seam.  She managed to pull it on at a mirror, looking at herself sideways, her coat on the floor, purse and package between her knees.

A short woman with frizzy orange hair slipped into the mirror, a bra over her dress.  “Do you have to hog the whole thing?” she whined.

Lillian apologized and stepped aside.  A sweater could always stretch and even if Mama didn’t sew up the rip it wouldn’t show.

Sharp-eyed, she hunted through the bins, picking out toys, slippers, razor blades, blouses.  Her feet hurt; she was hungry.  On her way to the subway she gobbled down a hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut.  She sat by the window, belching, watching her reflection, hugging the tender bundles on her lap.  Bargains for everybody.  She really accomplished something.

<p><center>§</center></p>

July, 1949.  Children are scooping wet sand, cute little children with tin pails.  Lillian looks for a Good Humor boy.  Her new bathing suit rubs a little—black latex, one-piece.  The tide is coming up.  Teenage boys are frantically digging a trench to protect a sand woman with bomb-shaped breasts.

A man walks toward her, his eyes traveling up and down her body.  She knows the look all too well.  Holding in her stomach, she swings her purse, heading up the beach toward the boy shouldering an ice cream box.  Her toes dig into the sand, her hips swivel.

She slides the wrapper off an almond crunch popsicle and jabs in the stick.  The man is standing by the water.  Her heart pounds.  Her age or older.  Plaid boxer trunks.  Tanned and muscular, with a black crew cut.  Presentable.  She makes her way through the crowd, concentrating on her ice cream.  He swings into step beside her.

“I noticed you yesterday, already,” he says in a bass-baritone.  He sounds American-born but you never know for sure.

“I don’t talk to strangers,” she says.

“Well, you just did, ain’t that right?”

She bites the popsicle.

“The prettiest girl on the beach, by a long shot.”

Keep your eyes open, Papa warns, watch your step.

“Sure-sure,” she says.

“So I guess you live around here,” he says.  “Flatbush, I bet.”

“Brownsville.”

“Brownsville!  I got a cousin on Saratoga, near Pitkin Avenue.”

“Oh, right down the street,” she says.  “How about you?”

“Sheepshead Bay.”

“That’s a very nice area.”

“I just got laid off.  If ya gotta get laid off summer’s a good time.”

“What kind of work?”

“Mechanic—cars, trucks, you name it.”

“I never met a mechanic,” she says.

“You learn things in the army,” he says.  “Hey—I’m Jack.”

“I’m Lillian.”

His arm brushes hers.  Life feels bigger, walking on the beach with a strange man.  She should throw away the popsicle, but she hates to waste a good ice cream.

“Want some?” she asks, holding it up.

He bends close, steadying her wrist, his touch so shocking she chokes on a piece of almond crunch.  Coughing, she pounds her chest while he pounds her back.  The crunch comes up and she swallows it.  His hand stays on her back; she feels every finger.

“That was awful,” she gasps.  “It went right down my Sunday throat.”

“You gotta be careful,” Jack says.  He drops his hand and they walk on.

“I guess a beautiful girl like you is married,” he says.

“No,” she says, ashamed.  “How about you?”

“I’m divorced.”

“Divorced!”  She nearly chokes again.  “That’s terrible,” she says.

He shrugs.  “Lucky no kids.  Hey, finish that pop, it’s melting.”

He’s a fast worker, she thinks, at least he’s not afraid of life.

They navigate aisles of hot sand.  She buries the popsicle remains with her toe.  They sit on her blanket, close, not touching.  His shoulders are oiled, his arms, legs, and chest hairy.  She sneaks a look for any scars, if he got wounded.  Nothing she can see, anyway.  She feels comfortable.  She shouldn’t, but she does.

“How come a beautiful girl is here all by her lonesome?” he asks.  He resembles Clark Gable without the mustache.

“It makes a nice change,” she says. “Usually I come with friends.”

“Hey, waddaya say, I take you out for supper.”

“Oh, no ...”

“I got a car.”  He nudges her with his elbow.

“Thank you anyway,” she says.

“Coffee, then,” he insists.  “Luchow’s is real quiet in the afternoon.”

They go to the beach a couple times, then they start going to matinees.  She sees Golden Earrings again, with Marlene Dietrich and Ray Milland.  They kiss.  She feels bowled over.  At home she adjusts her face coming and going, looking sour when she wants to laugh out loud.  Is she hoping for the impossible?  A man not only divorced but very common.  A smoker, a card-player.  No interest in music.  Always asking her to see his apartment.

Finally, after an early movie, she gives in.  She’s never done that, gone to a man’s apartment.  It’s a livingroom and kitchenette and smells of cigarettes. He pulls down the shades, turns on a lamp.  They sit on his couch; she can  guess what’s coming.  She feels a little dizzy.

“Why wait till we’re married?” he asks, pressing her against the cushions.
“Married!” she says.  “You don’t like music—you haven’t met my family or friends—I haven’t even mentioned you.”

“I tell ya baby, I  ain’t never felt this way before.”

Papa’s bald head rises up, larger than life—his stern mouth and square mustache, his angry blue eyes.  Jack squeezes her breast.  She manages to force Papa away.  Go ahead, Regina would say, it’ll cure your stomach aches.

“Is that a proposal?” she asks.

“Waddaya think?”

“I hardly know you,” she says.

“No time like the present,” Jack says, and turns off the lamp.  She closes her eyes.  He’s unbuttoning her blouse, pulling up her skirt, taking off her panties.  Her feelings and legs tangle with her clothing, heaving in a dark bin, the price tags catching on each other.

And then her knees bend and something goes up and down inside her and she rises out of darkness into the light of disappointment.

So this is it, she thinks.

<p><center>§</center></p>

Dinner is pot roast.  Papa eats automatically, reading the paper.  Mama keeps running to the stove.

“Listen,” Lillian says, “Papa—listen.”  She’s very nervous already.  “I want you should meet … I have a boyfriend ... it’s serious.”

Mama strokes the top button on her housedress, lips moving.

Papa’s knife scrapes the plate.  He glares, getting ready to start in.  She knows what he thinks.  Boyfriends are robbers—gazlunim—like politicians, generals, and the filthy rich.  The world is run by gazlunim, except Stalin.  He wants her to marry, but all her boyfriends are gazlunim.  His opinions squeeze her so tight she can hardly breathe.

 “So what does he do?” Papa asks.

“Temporarily he’s laid off, but he’s looking.”

“A boyfriend, a real boyfriend,” says Mama, lifting her hands in wonder.

“Laid off from what?” asks Papa.  “What line is he in?”

“Cars.  A mechanic,” she says, choking.

“A mechanic?  You can’t do better than a mechanic?  What kind of person becomes a mechanic!”

“Shhh, as long as he’s nice,” says Mama.  “Invite him to supper Sunday.”

“What do you want from me!” she screams.  “A laundry man is better?  Did you tell Regina don’t marry Izzy?”

“At least he makes an independent living,” Papa says bitterly.

“Shhh,” Mama says, “he should come Sunday—I’ll make meatloaf.”

“Where did you meet him?” Papa asks.

“Brighton Beach.”

“A bad business,” Papa says, spearing a potato.

“What do you want from me!” she screams.  She takes the dishes to the sink and stands close to Mama, watching her rub the deeply worn bar of Ivory soap, washing every plate, glass, and utensil with her fingers.

Sunday Lillian inspects the living room from the doorway.  Throw pillows lined up.  Coffee table polished.  Nuts and chocolates in cut-glass bowls.  She breathes on her engagement ring and shines it on her cheek; it’s a ruby circled by diamond chips.  A white net curtain billows gently; the plock of stick-ball drifts in.  Suddenly she notices the muslin-covered springs under the couch, sagging like a cow’s belly.  The room turns shabby.  Frayed upholstery, linoleum rug cracked around the edges, naked ceiling bulbs.  The pea-green walls are dotted with breast-shaped caps, fat from years of paint.  Her stomach knots.  If she had to sing in Carnegie Hall this minute she couldn’t feel any worse.

Papa starts singing “Meadowlands,” holding the low tones.  Everything’s going wrong.  She pounds the couch pillows, muttering, “I can’t stand it, I can’t stand it!”  She stomps into the kitchen.  The festive table calms her—gold-rimmed plates on a white linen cloth, a plate of pickles, rye bread.  And Mama, a clean apron over her funeral dress, two red lines across her lips.  Papa sits stubbornly at his place, singing while reading the Freiheit.  She should have warned Jack not to mention The Daily News.

Dumbwaiter pulleys squeak in the hall.  Papa takes out the garbage, chats with Mr. Wilner, and returns stone-faced, a new song escaping through his lips.

She evens the silverware while Mama tastes the soup for salt.  Tucks in the hairpins around Mama’s bun.  Her heart pounds so loudly it almost drowns out the doorbell.  Papa falls silent; Mama hangs up her apron.

Her fiancé here, in the foyer, smelling of Old Spice and wearing an Hawaiian print shirt.  He kisses her.  But no box of candy—doesn’t he know better?  She should have reminded him.  She brings him into the kitchen.

“This is Mama.  And Papa.”

Jack smiles and holds out his hand.  Mama, clutching her hands over her stomach, offers, “How you do,” in English.  Papa rises slowly, gives Jack’s hand one big shake, and sits down again.

“I’ll show you around,” Lillian says.

“Anything you say, sweetheart,” says Jack, his arm around her waist.

Papa’s eyes stab her between the shoulder blades.  She gets to show Jack her room, the bathroom, and the spare room, then Papa’s chair scrapes and he accompanies them, telling Jack how he came to America first and bought the furniture.  Frustrated, she looks at the curtained French doors to her parents’ bedroom, giving up her plan to show off their mahogany bed and matching dressers.  When Gladys and Sam got married, she remembers, Papa accompanied them to Niagara Falls.

The dumbwaiter pulley squeaks and Papa excuses himself to collect the empty pail.  Jack takes advantage to kiss her.

He compliments Mama on the vegetable soup, individual meatloaves, roast potatoes, and boiled carrots.  He reminisces about his childhood on Delancey Street, where his father, now dead, sold woolens from a pushcart.  Papa takes an interest.  Lillian translates a bit for Mama but mostly lets her sigh and fill their plates.  She picks at her meat loaf.

Regina and Izzy come up for Mrs. Wilner’s honey cake and fruit cocktail.  Izzy, who knows five words of French from having lived briefly in Canada, pumps Jack’s hand and shouts, “Parlez-vous français?”  Sylvia and Leon come in quietly.

They squeeze around the table.  Jack asks Izzy and Leon which are their favorite horses.

“Horses!” Izzy barks.  “We need horse racing like we need a hole in the head!  Higher wages, we need!  Not horses!”

“An American-born, with every advantage,” Leon mutters grimly.

“Okay, so pipe down,” Regina says.

Sylvia says raw carrots have more nutrition than cooked.  Jack says the Dodgers will win the pennant.  Izzy and Leon talk politics.

Lillian walks Jack downstairs.  In the dark alcove beneath the steps he presses against her, reaching under her skirt.

“Very nice family ya got,” he says.

“I feel all wrung out,” Lillian says, pulling away.

She hauls herself up three flights.  Everybody sits in the living room.  She sinks into the couch beside Regina.

“If you like him, you like him,” Regina says, “but a man without political opinions?  Izzy is crude, I grant you that, but he has political opinions.”

“Such a delicious honey cake,” Sylvia says, “and he didn’t finish it.”

“Gazlunim,” Papa says.
<p><center>§</center></p>

Gladys gets a postcard from Lillian.  The words wobble crosswise, widely spaced at the beginning and squeezed at the end.

<i>Dear Gladys,
Today was not warm enough for the beach.  Sunday night Tanya had a party it was a chip in.  It was very nice.  We did a lot of singing telling jokes and of course eating.  The weather is not hot but sunny.  We had a cold spell.  Something wonderful has happened.  Mama and Papa wish Sarah would write a few words.  I have to sing tomorrow, if I’m not nervous I can do well. <br />
love, <br />
Lillian </i><br /><br />
Gladys hands the card to Sarah, frowning.  “Something wonderful—another new dress she needs?”

Sarah reads between the lines.  “I bet she’s getting married,” she says.

<p><center>§</center></p>

December, 1949.  Frozen towels swayed on the line.  The radiators knocked.  Mama swept from the kitchen to the living room, praying at the doorsill.  A black year, she muttered, a black year.  In shul Lillian should be married, not City Hall—at least a rabbi in the house.  She’s marrying a stubborn mule.  Like Schloime.  He wrote wigs were forbidden in America, so she left her wig on the boat.  Her sister, a wigmaker, died in Auschwitz.  Why did Lillian give in?  What next?  A black year, a black year.

Gladys, Sam, and Sarah dragged their suitcases through the front door, snow on their coats, noses red.  “All in one piece,” Mama cried.  Sam took suitcases to the spare room and Gladys draped their coats over the bathtub.

Papa walked Sam to the kitchen table.

“Wallace will show Truman, yet,” he said, patting the newspaper.

“Maybe yes and maybe no,” Sam said, blowing on his hands.

Lillian made a fuss over Sarah and returned to her room.

Sarah stirred the pot of chicken soup, looking for yolks.  No luck.  When the chickens had three yolks her grandmother saved her one; only two and she gave them both to Howie.

Gladys marched straight to Lillian’s room without taking a snack.  Except for that card in August Lillian hadn’t written a word.  Regina kept her posted.

Lillian was trying on gold hoop earrings the size of bracelets.  She smelled of lily-of-the-valley.  Gladys glanced up at her closet, above a shoe drawer.  Blouses hung doubled up, skirts dangled off their clips.

“I hear he doesn’t listen to music,” Gladys said without preliminary, “he plays cards.”

“He’s fun to be with,” Lillian said sullenly.  Her older sister got on her nerves.  They were too much alike.

“And that’s enough?” Gladys asked.

“What are you mixing in for?”

“Well, people have to have something in common.”

“So—we like each other.”

“Like?  Only like?”

“At my age, I’m glad for like.”

“Thirty-six is still young.”  Gladys pushed hard to make an impression.

“Look what Regina got herself into, marrying Izzy for his sense of humor.  And Sylvia, with a man who doesn’t talk half the time.”

“Don’t drive me crazy!  We’re getting married Friday!”

“How about his friends?  That tells something ...”

“What do you want from me?”

“Regina says Tanya says he doesn’t fit in,” Gladys said.

“So what should I do—marry our friends?”

Gladys gave up.  “I’m very nervous to meet him.”

“Sam will like him,” Lillian said, “irregardless.”

“Sam,” Gladys said wearily, “you know Sam.”

Lillian rocked her hand and watched the ruby sparkle.  No mutual interests—so what.  He was a regular American.  Physical closeness they had.  She loved sex not for the act itself, which left her frustrated, but for the naked down-to-earthness of sweaty happiness.  She hardly even got stomach aches.  Probably Regina guessed she had a sex life; Gladys was naive.

“I made him take me to Lewisohn Stadium three times,” Lillian said brightly.  “He says with me he’d go anywhere.”

“He said that?”

“‘With you sweetheart, I’d go anywhere.’  That’s what he said.”

“You never can tell,” Gladys said hopefully.  “Sometimes people change.”

<p><center>§</center></p>

The smell of roast chicken, Ivory soap, and mothballs floats into the livingroom.  Sarah sits on the floor with Howie, playing casino.  Casino is one of Zeyde’s two contributions to her life.  The other is his gazlunim stories, about creatures who fly into top-floor apartments through open windows and steal things like jewelry and silverware.  She imagines gazlunim flying in at night—enormous pigeons with strong beaks, always managing to escape.

She wins.  Howie doesn’t mind.  He’s chubby and easy-going.  Phlegmatic, everybody calls him adoringly—not fat or lazy—phlegmatic.  He plucks a chocolate from the fresh box on the coffee table.

“Hope it’s raspberry,” he says.

“Is Jack nice?” she asks.

“Dunno,” he says.  “Yuck, walnut cream.”  He eats it anyway.

Phlegmatic is Lillian’s word—who knows where she got it.  Sarah can’t stand Lillian—mostly the way her feelings slop over like jewelry in her tins.  So frustrated.  Hungry for kisses.  Fake.  Making a fuss about her and Howie. Howie’s used to it, but she freezes up.  It’s a good thing Mommy married Daddy, that’s all she can say.

The doorbell rings.  She shoves the cards under a couch cushion.  In the kitchen Jack is unbuttoning his coat; he smells of cigarettes and cold weather.  Lillian makes a big entrance in one of her gypsy outfits—a flared black skirt, tight purple sweater, red belt, and gold hoop earrings.  Her hair’s in an upsweep.  Jack kisses her right in front of them.  She wipes lipstick off his mouth with her thumb and takes his coat.  Howie pinches her arm; she pinches him back.

Jack looks around.  Eyes like minnows, a pitted jaw.

“Let’s see,” he says, “You’re Sam, right?”

Daddy smiles warmly and shakes hands.

“You must be Gladys I heard so much about.”

“Very pleased to make your acquaintance.”  A snap judgment flashes across her mother’s face.

“And pretty Sarah,” Jack says, touching her shoulder, “I bet you have lots of boyfriends, sweetheart.”

“I’m only twelve,” she mutters, shrugging away.

He gives her a creepy look.

He puts his hands in his pockets, jingling coins and keys.  No tie.  His cuffs wrinkle over black loafers.

Regina chases them in the livingroom so she can set the table.

She and Howie sit on the couch with her parents.  Zeyde, sitting up straight in the armchair, reads the paper, humming like distant thunder.  Lillian stands in the doorway, hands on her hips, her sweater too tight.  She looks proud and a little worried.  Sarah picks cashews out of the nuts and raisins.  She looks up.

Jack stands behind Lillian, hugging her midriff.  Slowly, his hands slide up over her breasts, his fingers hairy and stubby, like little animals.  They lock on the fattest part.  Lillian smiles like a toothpaste model, making herself invisible.  Zeyde stops humming.

Zeyde will explode, Sarah thinks, he’ll make flames leap out of the gaslight caps, right through the nipples.  No one says a word, they don’t even breathe.  Lillian keeps smiling at the fire escape.  Jack looks like he ate something sweet.  From the kitchen comes a soft symphony of sounds—a metal spoon scraping a pot, Regina and Bubbe discussing gravy.

Something nasty oozes out of Jack.  Evil, she thinks, evil like in Edgar Allan Poe stories.  She feels it, a poison touching them, touching the furniture, leaving little marks that will never rub off.  The future unreels, her aunt getting awful stomach aches, Jack darkening Bubbe’s table on holidays.  Is staying single so terrible?  Jack rests his head on Lillian’s, his cheek in her hair, and, from across the room, his minnowy eyes lock on hers.  He smirks.  She clutches Howie’s hand.  Please dear God, she begs, though she’s given up talking to God, please don’t make Jack be my uncle.

<p><center>§</center></p>

Monday morning Lillian was so nervous about the blood test, Gladys wanted to take the subway with her, but Lillian waved her away.

Mama got a call at ten-thirty.  Did Jack phone?  At eleven Gladys talked to her.  No answer at Jack’s place, she said, should she call the police?

“Are you sure you got the time right?” asked Gladys.

“I’ll wait till one,” said Lillian.

She slumped into the livingroom in the late afternoon, coat open, shoulder bag dangling from her fist.  She sank into the couch.  Gladys, her snap judgment vindicated, phoned Regina.  Mama brought a glass of tea with lemon.

“Leave me alone,” Lillian cried, waving her away, “leave me alone.”

A washline trilled in the courtyard.  The phone rang.  Lillian sprang up.

“Tanya,” she said, sinking into the couch again, still wearing her coat.

Regina ran in; Regina took charge.

“There has to be a reason,” she said, “for everything there’s a reason.  Are you sure you went to the right place?”

“Here,” said Lillian, rummaging in her purse, “I got it written down.”

“Something so important as a blood test,” said Gladys, “and he doesn’t show up?  He’s not a very good character, if you ask me.”

“Papa bribed him,” Lillian said.  “Or he’s in the hospital.”

“Don’t talk crazy,” said Regina, getting up.  “There’s people I can call.”

After supper the sisters shut themselves in Lillian’s room.  Regina sat on the chair like a teacher.  Lillian, pale and red-eyed, perched on the bed between Gladys and Sylvia.

Regina’s hawk-like nose was sharper than usual; her small brown eyes glittered.  “I won’t beat around the bush,” she said.  “First of all—he’s married.”

“Divorced,” Lillian muttered dully, defiantly.

“Married, I tell you.  Her name is Doris.  They’ve been separated four years.”

“I don’t believe it,” Lillian said.

Regina flung up her hands, exasperated.  “I just finished talking to her this minute,” she shouted.

“So she’s lying.”

“She’s not lying, I assure you.  You think I can’t tell?  They have two kids.”

“He said no kids!”

“Second, he did this before.”

“Oy veh,” said Gladys.

Sylvia patted Lillian’s hand.

“Did what?” asked Lillian, eyes dark with rage.

“Got himself engaged, then backed out the day of the blood test.  In fact, he makes a habit of it.  This Doris doesn’t sound so nice herself.  She says he’ll call you up and ask for the ring back.”

“But it’s a present!”

“Who does such things?” Gladys said.  “A nut, he must be some kind of nut.”

“Don’t be naive,” said Regina.  She looked at Lillian sharply.  “Did you?”

Lillian cried out, a bark of pain.

“That’s all he’s after,” said Regina.

“What are you talking about?” asked Sylvia.

“Leave me alone!” Lillian screamed.

She lies curled up like a baby, knives cutting her stomach.  She groans.  Mama comes in.

“Go away,” Lillian cries, “what are you doing?”

Her mouth tastes terrible.  She licks the cold flat ruby, the sharp little diamonds.

A pulley squeals.  A window slams.  Papa sings “Ol’ Man River.”

She drags herself to the bathroom and locks the door.  She hardly has strength to pull the chain.  She holds onto the sink to brush her teeth.

She drags herself back to her bedroom.  Mama steps aside with a guilty smile.

“What are you driving me crazy for?” Lillian cries.

She curls in bed again, staring at the black telephone on its little table under the window.  Any minute it will ring.  She’ll have to say hello.  His voice hangs between the phone and a dream.

A tumult, a loud prayer from Mama, and Regina rushes in with Gladys, Sarah, and Howie.

Lillian sits up carefully, shoving the pillow behind her.  “I don’t feel good,” she says.

“That no-goodnik called,” Regina spits out.

“You he called?”

“If I had a gun that works on the telephone ... boy-oh-boy, I’d let him have it!”

“Don’t say such things.”

<i>By the burning fire <br />
They will glow with every coal. <br />
You will feel desire <br />
Whisper low inside your soul. </i><br /><br />
Regina is talking, chewing words.  “He said I don’t want to upset Lillian but I decided the marriage wouldn’t work out—just wouldn’t work out, he said—I really feel bad about it he said.  So I said I bet you do and he said I don’t think I’d make her happy.  And then he said I spent a bundle for the ring, would you ask her to send it back?”

Flies buzz in her head, all she hears is flies.  He fooled me, she thinks to steady herself, he fooled me.

“So I told him,” Regina rushes on, “I said, don’t you worry, but here’s what I think of you—what the whole world thinks of somebody like you.  You’re a skunk, that’s what I told him, you’re a skunk and nothing stinks worse than a skunk.”

She’s all mixed up.

“I guess I’ll send him the ring back,” she says.

“What!” Regina screams.

“I can’t wear it any more.”

“You could sell it.”

“It wouldn’t be right.”  She tugs the ring, bunching up a barrier of flesh.  “It won’t budge!” she screams.

“Hold on,” Sarah orders, “I’ll get you soap.”

Sarah greases her knuckle, her finger.  There’s no kindness in her touch.  It doesn’t matter, she just wants to sleep.  Sarah yanks.  Pain shoots up her arm.

She polishes the splotched gold on the sheet.  He saw through me, she thinks bitterly, I didn’t see through him—I wasn’t even in love—it just seemed possible, for once, to make a life.  And now what?  The ring shines.

“Maybe you could find me a little box?”  Her voice locks in her throat.  “In the top drawer someplace or maybe the telephone table.”

“Give it here,” Regina says, “I got something downstairs.”

Reluctantly she hands Regina the ring and they march out, leaving the door open.

She should find paper and write Jack a note so he doesn’t get off scot free.  What can she say to get under his skin?  She gropes for a mountain, the moon, the ocean; the sky holds all his wrongs and all her hurts.  A little memory creeps in, a little nothing she dismissed the minute it happened.  She was standing by his stove holding out a cup with a tea ball and he was holding the kettle, pouring boiling water, and he said, so softly she wasn’t sure he said it, “I could burn you.”  She squirms, eyes closed, and angry replies flash across her mind like ball lightning.

Tumult again.  She’ll ask Sarah to wrap up the box and Regina can take it to the post office.  He’ll know she has no hard feelings, that she’s bigger than hard feelings, that he’s so small he isn’t worth hard feelings.  The children barge in, followed by Regina, Gladys, and Sam.  Howie leads the parade, clutching a sagging piece of newspaper.  Carefully, seriously, her beloved nephew places the paper on her lap.  She aches for love of him, pulls his chubby face to her and kisses both cheeks.  He pulls away.

Mama comes in, then Papa.  Her room is full to bursting.  Papa grows taller, his eyes cold blue fires.

<i>“Gazlunim,”</i> he growls.

She looks down.  The paper holds ruby splinters, twisted gold, and diamond chips.

Regina’s voice comes from far away.  “I can’t decide whether to mail it or flush it down the toilet.”

“Mail it,” Sarah says, “or how will he know?”

The precious pieces swell and glitter.  Skeletal bodies lie piled in wagons, piles of eyeglasses and worn shoes, piles of gold fillings and gold rings.

 “What do you want from me!” she screams.  “Nobody listens—nobody ever listens to me!  Don’t you think I have a mind of my own!”
