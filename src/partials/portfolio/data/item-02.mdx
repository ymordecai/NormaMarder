Cynthia twisted her gold chain—her grandmother’s chain—knotting the supple coils.  The waitress took their orders.

	She wasn’t hungry, no time for hunger.  Making oboe reeds and housekeeping lists, waving the magic wand that turned the girls’ clogs into slippers.  A twenty-week opera season plus free-lancing—a good, hectic life.  Space around her children and husband—an economy of blind spots.  She was very thin.

Tim, across the booth, religiously cleaned his wire-rim glasses with lens tissue, wearing a brown shirt with blue suspenders.  Lunching with him was her little indulgence.  Men like Tim—sexy wind and brass players—used to frighten her back at Julliard, before she married.  Men were just people now, she was happy to say.

Along the diner’s far wall, plastic flowers hung on a landscape of Greek ruins.  Outside, the wind blew people eastward and obstructed them westward.

 “He’s too cerebral to conduct Verdi,” Cynthia said.

	“His pelvis is frozen,” Tim said, “you can’t conduct Verdi with a frozen pelvis.”  He settled his glasses and pulled a thick manila envelope from his clarinet case.  “Hey, it’s lunch, let’s do lunch.”  He set the envelope on her placemat, carefully aligning the corners.

	Tim brought her his photos tenderly and selfishly, as if they were Valentine gifts.  Inside the envelope would be black-and-white street scenes—buskers, sidewalk vendors.  She treated his hobby tactfully.

“I’m playing with exposures here,” he said, eyes shining with boyish confidence.

	She tugged out a stack of photos.

	Two naked women flanked a potted tree, hands on hips, smiling vacantly—two naked young women and a ficus benjamina.

She leafed through the prints, her silk blouse crackling like tissue paper with each breath.  Could he hear it?

	He slid into her side of the booth.  “The photography course is really opening up,” he said.  “We shot these in a greenhouse on West 67th—look at that.”  His finger landed on a blurry cone-shaped breast.  “Look at the contrast between flesh tones and leaves—that’s what I was getting at.”

	“Ah,” she said.  He sat close, absorbed and content.  His photos were grainy and out of focus; no contrasts.  She marveled, pulled up short, as Henry James would say.  Whenever his taste went blind she felt life itself was out of focus.  She breathed as little as possible.

	She flipped to a naked dancer with a mane of curly black hair and a deeply shadowed navel.  The girl leaned sideways, arms floating, knees bent—no, she wasn’t a dancer: her body was stiff, she looked embarrassed.  A clarinet stood on a stand.  It was all so trivial and self-indulgent.

	“I ran into problems lighting the figure at night,” Tim said.  “Look at the next one.  What do you think?”

	The girl wrapped an invisible overcoat around her.  She expressed homely pleasures—eating oatmeal, washing the bathtub.

	“The shadows on her back are interesting,” Cynthia said.

	The tall, pear-shaped waitress brought lunch, spikes of red hair escaping from her plaid beret.  Tim stuffed the photos in the envelope and slid over to his side of the booth.  Cynthia bit into a turkey melt.

	“Maybe it’s because Rosalyn’s younger,” he said.  “She’s not so judgmental.”  He adjusted his glasses with his thumb, the fork jutting above his left eye.

	“Ah.  She looks ... very serious.”

	“She’s an ethnomusicologist.”

	“What’s her specialty?” Cynthia asked, handing him her pleated cup of cole slaw.
	“Southern India—Madras.  She’s very easy to get along with.”  He cut a swathe through his salad.

	Cynthia felt a twinge of alarm, a shameful jealous twinge, altogether startling and out of place.  She tipped her head over her plate, her hair slanting heavily and silkily across her cheeks.  For a while they ate in silence.

	“Anyway,” Tim said, “I’m proud of myself.  For once I haven’t fallen for a clone of Stella.  Or Margo, either.”  His eyes shone wickedly, conspiratorially.  “I even tried her breakfast.”

	“No!  Was that sacrifice?  Or flexibility?”

	“Hey, is it always my fault?  Am I always the bad guy?”

	“You’re as fixed and habitual as a monk, my dear, so if she inspired you to deviate from bulgur wheat with honey ...”

“Gimme a break.  A bowl of bulgur holds you for hours.”

	She patted his hand.  “Let’s go, I haven’t looked at Trovatore in ages.  I’m not in the mood, either.”

	The owner rang up their bills on an antique embossed cash register, mouthing the numbers, his paper hat tilted rakishly.  They walked back to the theater, gloved hands in pockets, hunched against the wind.

	In the ill-lighted women’s lounge Cynthia looked in the steel-framed mirror.  She leaned her forehead against the glass, banged it twice, lightly.  Washed her face.  Folded towels dangled from the dispenser.  She patted her skin with rough paper.  Cheap management, she muttered, throwing the towel in the overflowing can.  Two violinists came in, arguing about a film.  Often, when she was alone, anger flared up from some smoldering source and consumed her.  She put moisturizer on her lips.  People said, you’re so lucky, Cynthia, you have a marvelous career, a successful husband, beautiful children.  She threw the tube in her purse.  Was she greedy?  If she drew a picture of herself, would she be an open mouth?  The anger subsided.  No nonsense, she told herself; a friend is a friend.  Sometimes at home, when Ralph and the girls competed for her attention, she silently chanted a mantra of Tim’s name.

	Rehearsal started with Azucena’s horrific revelation scene: the gypsy remembers the Count burning her mother at the stake, remembers snatching his baby son to throw in the pyre and, confused by grief and flames, tossing her own child.  The orchestration, Cynthia thought, tempered the melodrama.  Her simple line of descending semitones voiced Azucena’s memories—a two-note figure repeated obsessively—her oboe doubling the violins and tingeing them with a plaintive ghostly sound, a fateful cry, almost inaudible.

	She set out Thai food for herself and the girls while they sang the day’s tales of triumphs and indignations.  Abbey’s soap bubble experiment worked great on the computer.  Lottie dropped her math book in the fish tank.  She spooned beef in peanut-butter sauce over their rice.  What a pleasure to giggle with her daughters.  She gave them each a taste of plum wine.

	Ralph came home just as she was leaving for the theater.

	Early next morning she dashed to her studio to enter a dream in her journal.  Her hand surprised her, sprinting nervously across the page, skipping letters.  She could barely read her handwriting.  The showers ran, the teakettle whistled.

<i>I’m traveling through Europe in a sleeper train, the coaches square, the compartments square, each compartment holding one square bed.  Corridors are crowded with people and suitcases.</i><br /><br />

	<i>The Bulgarian and I lie, fully dressed, on opposite sides of my red velour quilt.  Everything in this compartment is red.  The Bulgarian is a great favorite, all the women want him.  He’s a handsome man with high cheekbones and wire-rim glasses.  Dangerous, dissolute, detached.  Daddy lies sleeping across the head of the bed, dressed in baggy longjohns.  I reach over and touch the Bulgarian’s face.  He needs a shave.</i><br /><br />

	<i>Daddy has vanished.  The Bulgarian and I embrace.  He feels small and soft against my body, like a child or a woman.  He becomes a man and we kiss.  His mouth is round and soft.</i><br /><br />

	<i>I sit under the quilt, naked, while the Bulgarian paces at the foot of the bed, smoking a cigarette.  His chest is covered with curly black hair, his back is smooth.  He’s relaxed, familiar, as if we’ve been lovers a long time or as if he’s very practiced.  I’m awed by the newness of it.</i><br /><br />

	<i>We make love, slowly, quietly.  The door opens and Daddy pads back in, like a grubby prospector in winter underwear.  We pretend to be asleep.</i><br /><br />

	<i>I push through the crowded corridor, looking for the bathroom, but find my mother instead.  She stands in a gray compartment, reflected in the mirror, wearing a filmy gray nightgown.  Scattered on the carpet are porcelain figurines of ballet dancers, clowns, and Siamese cats.  They lie or stand in duplicates, boxes and tissue paper all around, as if a salesman had spilled his samples.  Mother apologizes for the mess.  “They just aren’t serious,” she says.  I know Mother would disapprove of the Bulgarian.</i><br /><br />


Cynthia paused in the rehearsal room doorway.  The orchestra was warming up and light was absorbed into the floor.  Cellists hunched over their instruments; the tympanist tapped and bobbed.  People shuffled scores, adjusted stands, rosined bows.  This world existed without her, always existed: the music played all night, the lights burned.  She caught the elusive yeasty smell of daily expectations.  No matter if rehearsal were boring or unpleasant; what mattered was continuity—belonging to the work, being stretched and drawn securely into it.  She felt purposeful, almost religious, when she heard the scales and melodic fragments and saw the light and the cellists.

	She went to her chair, lifted her oboe from its blue velvet cradle, and vigorously cleaned the inside with a turkey feather.  She agonized over which reed to use.  Violins scurried through Sibelius and Mendelssohn, a trumpet brayed Bach, the French horn suffered.  Of all the basic cacophonies in life, tuning up was among the most delightful, along with birds in forests and children in playgrounds.

	Tim was talking to Dennis, the other clarinetist—Tim handsome in a black turtleneck and pleated cords, Dennis, Humpty Dumpty in one of his bright shirts.  Tim took his seat.  They said good morning.  Carefully, he assembled his clarinet, legs spread wide, fingers limbering on the keys.

	Cynthia sucked on her reed.  Dream history leaked into the moment.  They were side by side in the wind section, it was Thursday, they were rehearsing The Magic Flute, the conductor would arrive soon.  Tim turned to consult her and suddenly she felt they’d been intimate for years.  It was insane, almost something she could control if she wanted to, like letting her eyes unfocus and seeing double.  Ferns uncurled from her chest and stroked his face.  She felt secretive, her eyes lively with insinuations, her mind full of stories.  He should hold her hand—why didn’t he hold her hand?  Reality and dream doubled like scenes in a Kabuki play, the two of them in the wind section, and beyond, the two of them in a sleeper train.  “What’s the tempo here?” she asked, her voice deep and furry.  Did he notice?  Did she want him to notice?  Overlapping films fell on him, his contours were soft, he was blurred and lovely.  They studied the overture, hummed a passage, argued about phrasing.  Their shoulders touched briefly, then they warmed up on separate passages.

	Over the winter she had a series of comic erotic dreams.  Etched in words, they reproached her, the act of writing a betrayal.

<i>My old friend Linda sits on a metal folding chair, her long legs crossed, wearing silver glitter stockings with L.L. Bean gumshoes.  She has bright red hair and a toothy smile.  Tim lies under the chair, his hands pillowing his head.  Linda smiles down at him, pleased as punch.</i><br /><br />

	<i>I’m sitting on the floor, feeling rotten.  I ask Tim, “Was it as good as a real Swede?”</i><br /><br />

	<i>“Not as good as a real Swede,” he says, “but good.”</i><br /><br />

	<i>I can’t stand seeing Tim so relaxed, caged by those metal legs. </i><br /><br />

	<i>“Come upstairs,” I say, “we have some restaurant business.”</i><br /><br />

	<i>Tim slides out from under the chair feet first, like a seal.  He wears white patent leather shoes with pointed toes—gambler’s shoes.</i><br /><br />

	<i>The bed is a mess.  I straighten the sheet and the blanket.  Tim enters while I’m still bent over, erasing the wrinkles.</i><br /><br />

	<i>“Sit down,” I say.  We sit on the edge of the bed and I can’t remember what I wanted to tell him.</i><br /><br />

	<i>“I need some baby clothes,” I say, but that’s not it.  “What was it like?” I ask.</i><br /><br />

	<i>“Why her?”</i><br /><br />

	<i>Tim picks wool pills from the blanket and rolls them into little balls.  He seems to be looking at his genitals.  I want to touch him there, he’s so inert, so relaxed.  But I jabber aimlessly, like some idiot who won a prize on TV.  Tim pays no attention, rolling wool balls between thumb and forefinger.</i><br /><br />

	<i>The phone rings.  He answers.  “They want to order salami sandwiches,” he says.</i><br /><br />

	<i>“In an hour,” I say. “Tell them in an hour.”  I unbutton my blouse.  “There,” I say, “isn’t this Swedish, too?  Isn’t this the real thing?”</i><br /><br />

	<i>He looks at my breasts, then faces the wall again.  We both look at the wall.</i><br /><br />

	<i>“You can touch me,” I say.  “You can at least hold my hand.”</i><br /><br />

	<i>Tim has combined all the wool into one large ball and rolls it between his palms.  Slowly, deliberately, he looks me up and down, then attends to his ball of wool.</i><br /><br />

	<i>“What’s wrong with me?” I ask.  “Am I the wrong size?  The wrong shape?  Are the contents old and out of date?”  I laugh at my metaphor.</i><br /><br />

	<i>Air circulates around my breasts.  The nipples pucker as if they’d sucked lemons.  I button my blouse.  “Offer withdrawn,” I mutter.</i><br /><br />

	<i>I look down at his gambler’s shoes, so meticulously neat.  “Linda is waiting,” I say, standing.  “Time to open the restaurant.”</i><br /><br />

	<i>Tim lifts my blouse and kisses my navel, holding my hips.  He looks up, his dark eyes expressionless, and runs his finger down the invisible center of my body from throat to crotch.  He pats my stomach as if he owned it. </i><br /><br />

	<i>“Time to open the restaurant,” he says, heaving himself off the bed.  Arms around each other, we walk out.</i><br /><br />

“Marriage could ruin our relationship,” Tim said.  He put his sandwich down without biting it, his private life trailing behind him, a fish net snagged with debris.

“How does Rosalyn feel?” she asked, forcing herself into the present.

	“She wants to be pregnant while finishing her thesis.  It’s perfectly reasonable.”

	“Well, it sounds ... you seem attuned her.”

	“I feel we’re taking a huge step—given how relationships change.”

	“Some do, I suppose.”

	“How long have you been married?” he asked suddenly.  “About ten years?”

	“Fifteen,” she said, startled.

	“That’s a long time.  That’s one hell of a long time.”

	“My parents are married forty-three.”

	“It’s funny, Cynthia, I never think of you as anybody’s wife.”

	“Well, I suppose I’m not when I’m here.”

	“Or a mother,” he said stubbornly.

	“Ah.”  She frowned.  “That’s different.”

	“How come you never talk about Ralph?”

	“Oh, I wouldn’t.”

	“Ralph doesn’t exist.”

	“You’re awfully belligerent today—run out of cereal?”

	Tim leaned forward.  “I tell you about all the women in my life and my family and everything, but you ... you’re a clam.”

	“You never ask,” she said stiffly.

	His fine brown eyes looked wounded.  “I’m asking,” he said.

She imagined saying something over and over until it sounded like a lie.

	“We met in college, before I went to Julliard—I don’t know why he hung around—we didn’t particularly ....”  She stopped, then leaped into it.  “My family has absolutely no
imagination—no one admits it, mind you.  We’re stolid and superstitious, we marry to appease the gods and to keep the gene pool alive.”  She jabbed at her salad.  Greenish translucent seeds swam together in the dressing.  “I’m not all that secretive about my family, am I?”

	“Does the sun shine?  Did Bach write fugues?  Gimme a break, Cynthia.  All I know is your father’s a shrink, your mother runs Meals on Wheels, and your husband’s a CEO.”

	“A lawyer, actually.  Well, we’re Scotch-Presbyterian from way back—from Dornoch and Edinburgh.  Daddy has a very Scottish memory—the past aggravates him every bit as much as the present—maybe that’s why he’s a psychiatrist.  The women in Mother’s family ran thrift clubs and temperance societies, so her attitude ... they all think art is a weakness, almost a sin, but they serve on museum boards and arts councils.  I don’t know why I’m ... I didn’t want to be different, I wanted to fit in, I really did—I didn’t choose the oboe.  I’ll tell you something strange—something to do with the way the living interact with the dead.  The last witch burned in Scotland was burned in Dornoch in 1727—Daddy’s ancestor sentenced her—that made a terrible impression on me when I was little ... I don’t know what this has to do with music—I just came up through the family a bit different, that’s all, although not too different.  That’s my background.”

	Ants nibbled her wrists.  A voice seemed to whisper in her ear, something she didn’t want to know.

	“When Ralph and I married they expected us to move to Connecticut.  They thought I’d teach because obviously living in the city is immoral and being out almost every night ... well, mind you, they don’t say anything directly.  Mother just says, ever so politely, ‘the girls seem to have circles under their eyes,’ and Ralph’s mother says, ‘aren’t they a bit fat.’  My girls are healthy and independent, very secure.”

	She was crumbling.  An obligation was worming in, as if she were a patient on her father’s couch.

	“What about Ralph?” Tim said stubbornly, casting a hook on her tongue.  “What’s the worst thing about Ralph?  Tell me one small thing.”

	He reeled in the line and she gave herself up to betrayal, to the sweet, sick indulgence of resentment.  She pushed away her plate.  “You know those tacky figurines you see in midtown gift shops?  Cats with bows around their necks?  Cute little kitties?  Four tabbies in a teacup?  He has hundreds of them—over five hundred—on a walnut bookcase in his study.  Mind you, the girls aren’t even allowed to keep gerbils.  Not only figurines, but stuffed cats and cat plates, bronze cats, tea cozies, wood carvings.  His clients play into it, you see, and he picks them up—oh, there are so many, they’re like cockroaches.”  Her pulse raced, she was out of breath.

	“That’s way out for a lawyer.”

	“He says they’re cute.”  Her voice cracked.  “They’re disgusting.”

	“I’m sorry,” he said.

	She raced along.  “You wouldn’t believe the things I never resolve.  Ralph has a short list of permissible subjects—it took me years to figure it out: he won’t talk about anything he can’t control.  If I say something out of line, he changes the subject or shrugs.”  A door opened.  “Shall I tell you what we’re allowed to talk about?”

	Taut lines in Tim’s face grew ragged with indignation.  “I know that state, Cynthia, I know it.  Stella and I were so goddamn polite, we were like bank tellers.”  His eyes darkened.  “But we got divorced.”

	Cynthia stirred her salad.  “We talk about politics, the children, and the car.”  She nodded in a bitter salute.  “And his day.”

	“Not yours.”

	“But we get on.  There’s a certain freedom in it.”  Leaning forward, she looked deeply into his eyes.  “You know how you think eight measures ahead?”

	“Sure.”

	“Well, while Ralph rattles on about mergers I hear music or I plan the girls’ social life.  He monologues without being interrupted and I have the pleasure of thinking.”  She sat back.

	“A sort of mental infidelity.”

	“We give each other room.”  She felt justified.

	“All your feelings go into music, then.”

	“And the children.”

	“Gosh, family dinners must be a real joy.”

	“It’s not so bad,” she said protectively.  “He’s a decent man.  He’s politically astute and very generous.”

	“Cynthia, you have a deadly habit of putting your emotional life in compartments.  I bet the old woman at the stake isn’t your only secret; I bet you have a whole closet full.”

	“I might,” Cynthia said.

	He looked at his watch.  “Damn, I have to go.  We’ll talk some more tomorrow.”

	“Marriage will be different for you this time,” she said.

	“Any difference is welcome,” he said.  “I wish I could stay.”

	She felt as if she’d been rehearsing with a bad reed.  “See you tonight,” she said, and sipped her coffee.

	The last witch burned in Scotland: old Janet Horne, tortured, strangled, and burned in a pitch barrel because she turned her daughter into a pony and rose her to a witches’ Sabbath.  Cynthia used to identify with Janet Horne—used to imagine a poor cottage where the old woman lived with her lame daughter and lame grandson, concocting herbal remedies and cursing her neighbors.  Old Janet was falsely accused—authorities, yes, her multi-great-grandfather, found her cranky disposition devilish.  Anyone could be misinterpreted, distorted.  Like Azucena’s mother.  Right now parents upstate were being accused of child abuse for photographing their toddler naked in the backyard.  One never knew what was inside anyone.  Surface was everything.  No matter how far down one went, it was still the surface.

	Janet Horne’s last moments always haunted her.  “It is said that after being brought out to execution, the weather proving very severe, she sat composedly warming herself by the fire prepared to consume her while the other instruments of death were making ready.”

	A shoulder twitched, a fly buzzed.  Composed?  No way.  Thumbscrews, breaking irons, sleep deprivation.  Old Janet was mad—gone in mind and body—truly a witch, coaxing warmth from her own visionary fire.

	A thread spun out of the smoke and drifted to the sky, growing thinner and thinner, twisting as it rose, like her oboe’s plaintive sounds and controlled cries—austere, almost human—interpreting music while it interpreted her.

<i>I am pregnant again at my age and need maternity clothes.  There are none in the attic, so I go to a used clothing store, a depressing place lined front to back with parallel racks of dark and shabby clothes, inferior quality to begin with.  I look for a salesperson.  In a tiny, dim office, a few steps above the main floor, the manager is eating lunch at a cluttered desk.  He is fat and sloppy and wipes grease from his mouth with the back of his hand. </i><br /><br />

	<i>“Can you give me some assistance?” I ask.</i><br /><br />

	<i>He comes down to the racks, tucking in his dirty white shirt, and calls for a saleswoman.  She leads me into a stylish, carpeted boutique where they carry designer maternity fashions.  I flip through the slacks, find a nice pair of white jeans, and stand at the mirror, holding them up against me.  But the crotch is scorched, as if someone had held a match to the inseam and the flame had smoldered there.</i><br /><br />

Cynthia felt gloomy and irritable, fighting a spring cold, maybe.  The soup of the day was creamed chicken with corn.  Pieces floated on top.

	“I’ve got some news,” Tim said.  His cheeks were flushed high on the bone. He radiated malignant energy.

	“Did you quarrel with Rosalyn?” she asked.

	“I’m leaving the orchestra,” he said.  His lips twitched.

	Wind propelled her backwards, lifting her feet.

	“I’m going to teach,” he said.

	He was small and blurry, his voice wind-blown,

	“At Indiana University,” he said.

	“Ah.”

“It happened very fast.”

	She came to rest, a tree far down the road.  “You’re insane,” she said.

	“I know the arguments,” he said, warding her off.

	“That’s no life for you ...”

	“They made me a good offer.  Teaching, performing, some conducting ...”

	“It’s a desert out there.”

	He bit savagely into his sandwich but seemed to have trouble swallowing.

	She returned, blighted.  “Why didn’t you say anything?”

	He set down the sandwich.  “Well, Indiana’s a good place for Rosalyn to get her Ph.D.”

	“So ... but you ... I mean, consider the consequences.”

	He blinked, eyes intent behind his lenses.  “Look, Cynthia, New York isn’t the only place to make music—I hope not anyway.  Don’t make it harder.”

	The wind roared again.  If she ran far enough, time would be reversed when she returned.

	“It’s a good department,” she forced herself to say.

	He nodded gratefully.  “Indiana’s one of Rosalyn’s top choices,” he said.  “It seemed like an omen.”

	“You agonize over everything else.”

	“I agonized over this, I assure you.”

	“Keeping it a secret.”

	“I knew what you’d say, word for word.”

	Her face was hot.  “Well,” she said, “you’ll be one of the great pedants of the Midwest.”

	“I’ll scare them half to death.”

	“They’ll adore you.”

	“I’ll make them learn circular breathing.”

	“Speaking of new music, what happens to the quintet?”

	“Dennis is interested.”

	She sighed, imagining wry, elephantine Dennis in Tim’s chair.

	“Indiana’s not Siberia, Cynthia.”  He looked puzzled and consulted his sandwich.  Melted cheese congealed around the single bite, glistening on the crust.

	She tucked her hair behind her ears and cleared her throat.  A lump remained.

	“What’re you going to do with your loft?” she asked.

	“Give it up.  What do you think?”

	“Sublet it.  You might hate the department—you might hate teaching....”

	“I’m sorry,” he said softly.  “I’ll write you long letters.  All about academia.”

	“There’s no one, I mean no musicians I feel this close to,” Cynthia said, before running backwards again.  “I don’t know what I’ll do without you.”

	“I’ll miss you, too,” said Tim, reaching for her.  They leaned across the table and clasped hands.  He was all eyes.  She couldn’t see the rest of his face.

<i>I am sitting naked in a small, dim cafe, waiting for Tim.  I feel embarrassed, although no one is staring at me.  My embarrassment is terribly real, not mitigated by being a dream.  I am really in the cafe, I am really naked and chilly.  The waiter takes my order.  Since Tim hasn’t come, I decide to look for him outside in spite of what this means about exposing myself.  I walk between tables where couples drink and talk, past the bar, step out the door, and look for him in the alley.  The cafe is tucked away between brick walls, there is no view.  I return to my table.  I have different feelings about the nakedness of different parts of my body.  Naked breasts are tolerable, but not genitals. I’m most naked when seen from behind.  My embarrassment is so thick, it wraps itself around me like a cloak.  With relief I sit down, the table and chair serving as clothing.  I sip white wine.  The cafe is noisy, people are having a good time.  Risking exposure again, I leave.  Just outside the door a man’s black raincoat hangs on a nail.  I put it on, enormously grateful.  </i><br /><br />

Instrument cases lay scattered about the green room; poker players dealt cards on a medieval table.  The Meleus Orchestra was in the museum to play a benefit.  Tim looked beautiful in concert black, like an Irish monk she once knew in Rome.

	“You realize this is our last performance,” Cynthia said, touching his arm.
	“Oh, you never can tell.”

	“I want to tell you something later.  After the reception.”

	“Rosalyn’s here,” he said, “but I’ll work something out.”

	“Ah.  So is Ralph.”

	On stage she played the A and the orchestra bleated.  Everything sounded very loud.  Light glared on her music; notes leaped out.  This might the last time we play together, she thought, and grew calmer.  The conductor raised his baton and they played Mozart’s concerto for flute and harp, the clarinet’s supple tones leaping and coiling beside her.

	Since the concert was a benefit, musicians mingled with the guests at a buffet and bar.  Ralph often attended benefits, he liked benefits.  She paraded with him, chatting with acquaintances, nibbling shrimp and melon.  Tim was introducing Rosalyn around.  Cynthia focused on managing time.  Periodically she caught Tim’s eyes over people’s shoulders.  He brought Rosalyn over and the four of them chatted amiably by the turkey galantine.  Rosalyn was a pleasant, intense young woman with thick glasses, her hair rolled in an untidy bun, her nails bitten to the quick.  As Tim had said, she was easy to get along with.  It seemed her chief virtue.

	“The flute and harp were well matched,” Tim said to Ralph.

	“It didn’t reach any heights,” Ralph said dryly.

	The crowd thinned.  Ralph and corporate acquaintances were telling jokes at the bar, laughing and slapping each other on the back.  Patience, patience, Cynthia said to her nerves.
	A tap on her shoulder made her jump.  “Dennis is driving Rosalyn,” Tim said in her ear. “I’ll walk them to the car.  Be ten minutes.”

	Razor blades hinged her elbows, ants crawled in her wrists.  Was she really going to tell him something so personal?  He’ll be offended, she thought, he’ll think I’m a vampire, feeding off him for my emotional life.  She felt exhilarated yet calm, counting measures before a solo.

	Tim returned, all was well.

	“The green room’s probably empty,” she said.

	They headed for a modular sofa and sat in the angle.  She neatened her gown while he cleaned his glasses with a handkerchief.  His eyes were large and dark, the area beneath white and delicately veined.

	“Can I hold your hand?” she asked.

	“Any time,” he said.

	“Something peculiar’s been happening over the past few months.  I mean, something in my inner life that involves you, and I’ve been tempted to share it but I couldn’t.  Do you remember when you asked if I have any mysteries?”

	He looked at her intently without his glasses.

	“I practiced that beginning,” she said, embarrassed.  “It’s hard to start.”  She began again, slowly and softly.  “I’ve been dreaming about you, Tim.  Erotic dreams.  And funny, too; I’ve never had that happen before.  I mean, I’ve had fantasies about men I was attracted to—even occasional dreams, but not a whole series.  And, anyway, it doesn’t apply to us.”  She paused, nervous and out of breath.  “How does that make you feel?”

	He was smiling, beaming.  “Fantastic,” he said.  “Wonderful.  I have this feeling right here.”  He put his free hand on his stomach.  “Tell me more.”

	“Any more is too complicated, except for the dreams.  I could send them to you.  They’re in my journal.  Would you like me to?”

	“Yes,” he said, pressing her hand.  They looked into each other’s eyes.  “How do you feel?” he asked affectionately.

	“As if I’ve just played the Poulenc sonata.”  They laughed.

	“You know how it is,” she said, “when you give up a secret.”  She felt young and sad.  “Did you notice anything?”

	“Just that you’ve been very sweet to me.  But I thought maybe I’ve changed because of Rosalyn and it carried over.”

	“Actually I got confused sometimes.  The dreams created a whole different relationship with you, a kind of time warp.”

	He shook his head sadly.  “I don’t see how you could sit there and not show it.  It’s so like you, Cynthia, it’s almost scary.  I’m very flattered.”

	They sat silently.  He caressed the back of her hand with his thumb.  She caressed his, wrapped in a warmth tighter and softer than friendship.  Suddenly the tension snapped and they laughed, leaning back against the couch, and finally embraced.  Their knees got in the way.  He looked at her solemnly for a moment, very concentrated, then kissed her.  His mouth was soft and round, as in the dreams.

	“Anything else you want to tell me?” he asked.  He stroked her hair.  Her hand rested on his knee.

	“Nothing.  There’s absolutely no sexual attraction between us.”

	“Not at all,” he said, looking at her tenderly.  “Not before.  Not now.”  They kissed again.

	“I wanted to invite myself over to your loft and we’d listen to old tapes,” she said wistfully.  “Just to say goodbye.”

	“Let’s do it.”

	“I wanted to ask you to dinner and we’d play duets afterward.”

	“There’s still two weeks.”

	“I can’t.  I just can’t.”

	A nervous light quivered and she searched through it, as through a crowd, for anything she might have left out.  The light settled and she felt empty and peaceful.  They sat quietly, looking at each other.

	“I hate to say it,” she said, “but if I don’t go back soon Ralph will have kittens.”

	“Very funny,” he said.  “Stop being afraid of him.”

	“I’m not afraid of him.”

	“Sure you are,” he said.

	“No, I’m not.”

	“You are.”  He pulled her to her feet.  “Will you send me the dreams?”

	“Yes.  Will you really write?”

	“Long boring letters.  I promise.”

	They lifted their instruments from the table and walked into the corridor, arms around each other.  Back in the reception room a few clusters of people remained.  Ralph strode toward them, his face stiff.

	“Do you realize what time it is?” he said.

	“You’ll want to congratulate Tim,” she said quickly, “he’s taken a job at Indiana University.”

	Stolidly, Ralph changed course.  “Getting out of the rat race?” he asked, his eyes blank.
	“Out of one.  Into another,” said Tim quietly.

	“One second, Ralph,” she said, handing him her oboe, aware she was imposing.  “I’ll be right back.”  He accepted it gingerly, as if it were contaminated.

	In the dim corridor she and Tim hugged solemnly, the curves of his body rounding into hers, breath with breath, cheek against cheek.  They kissed.  It was sweet.

	“We’ll have you out to play,” he said fervently.  “You’ll do a residency or something.”  Tenderly, as if he’d often made the gesture, he tucked her hair behind her ears.  “Thanks for telling me.  It means a lot.”

	“I’m glad,” she said sadly.  He turned and strode away, his clarinet case swinging against his leg, and disappeared around the corner.

	She leaned against the wall and breathed deeply.  Afraid?  Afraid.  Perhaps.  Ralph wasn’t merely detached.  He was frustrated and menacing, a hunted creature.  His menace choked her, diminished her.  She was an appendage—someone he could boast about.  How could he know what he did to her if he didn’t know her?

	Briskly she crossed the room.

Ralph held her case, dipping a cracker into something green.

	“Well,” she said, “I’m ready to go if you are.”  She reached for the handle and felt some resistance, some reluctance to let go.

	“You kept me waiting long enough,” he said.

	They took the elevator to the parking garage.  In her mind two lines from a folk song played over and over in the sad, precise voice of Joan Baez: <i>“I woke from my dream and all idols was clay/ And all portions of lovin’ had all flown away.”</i><br /><br />

	In the car she leaned back, eyes closed.  Her compartments were dissolving, vaporizing.  Where was she?  Naked, undefended, open to scrutiny.  Did she want to know Ralph?  Did she want him to know her?  And how did their formality affect the girls?  Empty boxes nested, space within space.  She’d handed him her oboe; he’d taken it and waited, more frightened than hostile, it seemed, reluctant to let go.  Suddenly her image of him exploded like sparks from a damp log, the pieces spinning up into the dark.  She looked inward to the rooms where they lived, toured their life room by room.  Walls glowed and buckled.  The living room shrank, turning into a furnace she’d seen years ago at Murano.  Glass was melting on red coals, shining blobs of molten glass oozing over the coals, fiery and glossy, waiting for the glass blower.
