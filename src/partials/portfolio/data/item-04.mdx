Eva sits on a red milk crate, eating a tuna sandwich.  Noon-pale sea beyond the treetops, gauzy at the mainland.  In the village this morning two painters walked ahead, one losing his eyesight, the other his memory.  Glancing at Fish Beach, the one with macular degeneration said, “The sea is very blue.”

“Look at all that gray,” said the one with Alzheimer’s.

“The blue, the blue!”

“The gray, the gray!”

Wrinkled hands brushed the air.

Yellow calendula in the flower tub; basil under netting.  A dusty dry spell on the island.  Day-trippers struggle uphill around the bend, gasping, resting briefly in the shade.  Daily, yearly they round that stony curve, an endless stream of bright hats and shirts, regular as waves beating against rocks, as gulls lined up on a fish house.

Weary parents trudge downhill with little girls—the younger tugs her father’s hand, whining for an ice-cream cone with double scoops.  Her sister, lagging behind, sings “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town.”  Sad, kids blotting out the moment with a Christmas song and buy-me-buy-me—their parents probably walk the trails asking if there’s anything to see.  Wait a minute, though, what’s the moment?  She laughs.  They’re cooling off by imagining ice cream and Christmas.

Her ideas often flip-flop like hooked fish, the scaly side and the tough white belly.  Lecturing, she tries to catch them in the turning.  She’s a professor of Family Studies.  Self-creation within dynamic social structures.  The positive effects of exile and alienation.  Personal deprivations as sources of inspiration.

As the kids’ voices waft uphill, she circles a pattern in the past, a shape so familiar she can’t see it.  She feels its heat circling low over an art book her husband checked out of the library, about the Mexican surrealists.

A painting by Remedios Varo, “The Lovers.”  A man and woman, thin as saplings, sit on a forest bench, hands clasped.  Their heads, gold-framed mirrors on slender gold handles, face each other with identical reflections.  Steam from their bodies swirls up through leafless trees, condensing into delicate rain that pools around their legs, threatening to drown them.
<center>§</center>

Forty years ago, at the start of college orientation week, she walked in a forest grove at dusk.  A tall, lanky boy approached on the path, hands in the pockets of his windbreaker.  He said “Allo,” in a husky, French-accented voice.  His hair was red, his eyes were green.  He was a war refugee.  His name was Lewis.  They kissed.  Her soul’s twin, her reflection, the prince who rode through brambles.

She grew up in a mill town during World War II, the only child of immigrants.  She imagined being a lawyer.  Eva Carp, the sign on her door would read: I defend only innocent people.  She was tall and nearsighted and bumped into things.  She dropped stones from the bridge, watching them make rings, people influencing the world.

The morning after falling in love, she and Lewis sat in a shaft of sunlight, eating watery scrambled eggs and toast.  Her dorm was a medieval castle with scholarship rooms high in the tower and the cafeteria below ground, ringed by a clerestory with narrow windows.  Lewis hunched forward, his wrinkled white shirt open at the collar.  She adored his brick-red hair combed back in waves, his vibrant green eyes, his bone structure, his sharp-edged smile.  He had dimples like hers and a nose almost as large as her father’s.  A raisins-and-almonds face, sweet and bitter, expressions flickering and changing.  They talked with their hands.  His were the long-fingered hands of a cellist.

“I never talk about it,” he said in a deep, accented voice.  His eyes shone with grief.  “I was born here, in America, in Passaic, New Jersey, but I grew up in Alsace-Lorraine.  With my grandparents.  On their farm.  My folks were so stupid.  They lost the grocery in the Depression—I got born and they got knocked out.  Mama had no family to turn to, but Papa had cousins sailing to France, so they sent me over.  It seemed logical.  I was eight months.”  He jabbed his eggs nervously.

Eva imagined a woman in a black coat with a fur collar standing at a ship’s rail, holding a baby swaddled in a blue blanket.  When her own grandfather abandoned the family, her mother, only six, carried her baby sister to the bomb shelter.

“Papa promised he’s on his feet in two years.”  Lewis’s eyebrows curled upward like caterpillars.  “Bad luck always follows him.  The Nazis invaded France and I was stuck, that’s it.”

“You’re lucky you’re alive,” she said.

“I guess,” he said.

“What finally happened?”

“I got evacuated to a DP camp, then back to Passaic.  I was eleven.  Sometimes I wonder did they match me up with the right folks.”  He made a sad grunting sound.

In the afternoon freshmen crammed into an auditorium for aptitude tests and Rorschach blot tests, revealing personality secrets in good faith.

“My advisor says major in social work,” she told Lewis miserably.  They lay face to face in a nest of dry leaves, heads propped.  “I’m too altruistic and intuitive for law.  I felt … I don’t know … plain … reduced.  You know, like you think you’re original and you overhear somebody say you’re boring.  Social worker?  Never.  How about you?”

“Creative arts and teaching,” Lewis said.  “My advisor says major in drama or languages.”

“Am I fooling myself?”

“Don’t feel bad, Evie,” Lewis said, kissing her.  “You’ll be whatever you want.”

They lay in the grove every evening after supper, reading by flashlight and petting inside their clothes.  Petting, that’s what it was called.  Lewis wrote love poems in flowing European script.  He wanted them to “go all the way”—it would be her first time.  But her desire for knowledge trumped love; she knew him in color, not in detail.  She needed to ask the questions she couldn’t ask her father, needed his stories.

“Did Nazis come right to the farm?” she asked, tracing his cheekbone.

	“What do you want from me?” he snarled, pushing her hand away.

	“I read an article about the French occupation,” she said, stroking his cheek again. “For instance, how the Nazis went house to house making people put German labels on their water faucets.”

	“So who had running water?” he snapped.  “Look, we didn’t stay there always, geez, how could we?  They bombed us—houses were burning—poof, poof, poof!”

	“Shh,” she said, ashamed.  “Where did you go?”

“Geez, we hid, Eva.”  His lips swelled and turned purple.  “We always hid.”

She understood secrecy; her parents were Communists—progressives, they called themselves.  Children of progressives, like children of alcoholics, shielded their parents.  A fishbowl covered her head.  Hating propaganda phrases—capitalist war-mongers, workers of the world—she longed to hold ordinary opinions.  At the same time, deep in a haloed place, idealistic people held picnics in the sun, singing songs about equality and raging against social injustice.

Injustice came in the form of poison ivy, afflicting their erogenous zones—Eva’s stomach, Lewis’s penis.  He landed in the infirmary.

 “Feeling any better?” she asked, perching gingerly at the edge of a chair.  He sat in bed, pale and listless, a blanket up to his chest.  She gave him a large chocolate bar with almonds.

“I wish I could cut it off.  I would just cut it off.  Take a look.”  Lewis flung aside the blanket.  A fat gauze-wrapped limb tilted out of his pajamas.

“It must be excruciating,” she said.  “My stomach itches something horrible.”
His lips swelled and darkened.  “For me it’s worse,” he said petulantly.  “All that pain.  And no satisfaction.”

Dread rolled in like fog.  Numb, she read him Wordsworth.

She dragged herself up the cement stairs to her room, climbed to the top bunk, and lay on her back.  Scratch me, the itch screamed, scratch me.  With the very tips of her nails, she delicately tickled the skin round and round her inflamed stomach.

Sartre comforted her.  Nausea and alienation.  Existential autonomy.  Getting to know the otherness of another.  Being known.  Life is a futile passion, she read.  We live in anguish, responsible for our choices.

Shivering in her wool coat, she waited on the stone terrace.  Lewis was late, he was always late.  Maple trees revealed their crabbed skeletons.  He loped up the path.  A reproach, an apology, a kiss, then they snuggled on a stone bench against the balustrade.  Five children, they’d agreed, and a big house in Paris with two studios.  He was so wonderfully sweet and paternal, calling her Evie.

	“Promise me something,” he said, his hand in her coat, playing with her nipples.

	“What?” she asked, in a blissful haze.

	“From our first child,” he murmured.  “Your breast milk.”

“The baby will need it,” she said.

	“Just a little.”

	“All right.”

	“You’ll give me some?”

	“If you want.”

“What if you marry someone else?”

“I’ll mail it to you,” she said.
<center>§</center>

Some people would have, Eva thinks, sitting on the red milk crate forty years later.  The woman who mailed out hand-made books containing blotches of her menstrual blood.  And artists like John Cage, playing games of chance over long distances, holding fast to their end in a tug-of-war with fate.  She admires their perfect stubbornness, their Confucian certainty that proper timing influences the world.  She’s too practical.  She creates ceremonies in her mind but doesn’t enact them.

She has a cousin, an obscure composer, who, in the late sixties, organized a five-minute conceptual happening in which five musicians, across the continent, played a tone cluster, sounding one note apiece in private spaces, indoors and out, from New York to California.  Synchronized across time zones, each instrument entered a second later, hearing only itself and imagining the whole.  What glee for her cousin—master of sounds out of silent spaces—what control to have yoked five devoted souls, trusting that, in a state of pure concentration, glued to their watches and thinking of him and one another, they faithfully sounded their single tones.

All right, so she didn’t send Lewis her breast milk.  Maybe, in Cagean fashion, remembering was sufficient.  After all, she couldn’t very well say to her husband, “I know the baby needs a bath and we’re out of cereal and you have a client at four, but look, could you watch him while I expel some breast milk in a jar and wrap it in a shoebox and take it to the post office and mail it to my first boyfriend?”  It rankles that she’s so practical, so mired in the needs of the moment, that she jumps to conclusions but has no faith.

Since false memories are half-truths, she tells her classes, they bind the teller to the listener.  Don’t be fooled by the feeling tone, the punishing insistence laced with yearning.  Real incest memories have the hardness of tooth-scarred bones, the crabbed tracks of fact.  False memories have a different authenticity.  Take the hot wires in your hands carefully and defuse allegories tangled in suffering.  Listen to the language of little details.  How can the teller know if real grievances have mutated into false charges?  How can the listener know when facts are false, though emotions are true?  The story, she says, it’s all in the story.

Take this down.  Four narratives:  A woman remembers protecting her father when she was six, then learns he disappeared when she was two.  The daughter of a cold perfectionist has shadowy memories of being sexually fondled.  A man whose father randomly beat him believes his father seduced him.  The daughter of a brutally violent father sees him raping her in a satanic ritual.

The unconscious, abhorring a vacuum, corrects terrible deficits.  Armies of children deprived of affection grow into adults repelled by the attention they crave—perched on ice peaks, they wail across tundras, their starvation exposed by furious fantasies of closeness.  Men cry that women devour them, and women cry that men oppress them, behavior and belief cruelly crosshatching, deprivation turning into destructive connection.

<center>§</center>

The Trojan Women director taught them to see the whole beyond the parts.  Eva was in the chorus and Lewis was Poseidon, king of the underwater world, delivering the play’s introduction in resonant musical cadences.  “I haf come up from ze salt sea depths of ze Aegean/from where ze sea nymphs footsteps fall/ weaving ze lofly measures of ze dance.”  Regal presence, emotional power—a magic, Protean spirit.

But offstage Lewis was dull, reduced, and late to rehearsals.  He argued with the director, forgot lines in his scene with Athena.  Love, Eva discovered, was humiliating—menstrual blood staining a white dress, her childhood dread that Judgment Day would catch her on the toilet and drop her, toilet and all, on the front lawn.  No one liked him.  Why could he remember a long monologue but not a short dialogue?  What distracted him?  Between scenes he sat alone in the auditorium, hunched and sullen, feet on a chair back, hugging his knees.  When he bungled the dialogue at open dress rehearsal, the enraged director ran down the aisle and tossed a script over the footlights, threatening to make him use it in performance.  Lewis snorted and stamped his foot.  “It’s not my fault,” he muttered.  “She gave me the wrong cue.”  Eva couldn’t discuss him with Jack and Karen, her friends in the cast.  She couldn’t ask them to pity the emaciated child forever scrambling through thickets and crouching in caves.

After rehearsals they went to the boiler room beneath a stone dorm near the Castle.  One night, lit by the fiery glow of an enormous furnace, they stripped—Lewis fast, Eva reluctantly.  It was his idea.

When Eva’s breasts started developing, her mother noticed one was larger and dragged her to a doctor.  He made her strip to the waist, then consulted an illustrated tome of abnormalities, the size of Webster’s Unabridged.  Look here, he said, drawing Eva close to a page.  Framed by small type was an embarrassed naked girl with one small breast and one grotesque balloon reaching her navel.  That might happen to you, the doctor said.  Over the years the enormous breast, bulbous at the bottom as if weighted with fluid, lengthened in Eva’s memory, reaching her thigh, her knee.  Fear of deformity deformed her.  She invented privacy strategies in summer camp.

When Lewis emerged from a fiery pillar, skin glowing and penis bobbing in a nest of red curls, she hurried into her confession.  “The right one is bigger,” she announced, arms glued to her sides.

“I don’t see any difference,” he said.

She hugged him, kissing the red curls on his chest, melting like an ingot in a blast furnace, the incubus dissolving.

“Let’s make a bed with our clothes,” he breathed in her ear.

“I can’t,” she said, pulling away.

“Always you say no.  Geez, don’t you love me?”

“Yes.  I don’t know why.  I guess I’m not ready.”

“Not ready,” he said, stamping his foot and turning away.  “Not ready.”

All on his own, Lewis invited the cast to the boiler room for a recital of Bach cello suites.

“Invite your roommate,” he told Eva, smiling nervously, “Saturday at eight.”  It was an enormous step for him.

She arrived early.  Candles in sand-filled paper bags transformed the boiler room into a glorious salon of ducts and lights.  Blankets covered the floor; the enormous furnace growled.  A red glow flickered on the cello, lying on its side.

Handsome in a black sweater and brown corduroys, Lewis was pouring crackers on paper plates and setting them on upended cartons.  “I borrowed some blankets,” he said.

	“It looks beautiful,” she said.

	He sat on the edge of a folding chair and carefully tuned his instrument.  Shadows danced under his eyes; his hair glowed.

“So where is everybody?” he asked.

	“How many said they’d come?”

	“Everybody, I’m sure,” he snapped.  He adjusted the music stand, closed his eyes, and played scales, sniffing as the pitches ascended.  He tested a phrase, stopped, looked at his watch, played a few more phrases.

	Footsteps clattered down the stairs—Eva’s roommate Gloria, a violinist, and her boyfriend Sten, a gloomy Swedish psychologist.

	“Please not to mind,” Sten muttered.  He was an alcoholic, wearing a frayed black coat and wool scarf.

	“Wonderful, sit anywhere,” Lewis said happily, opening the score.

They made nervous small talk while Lewis warmed up.  The candles flickered.  The furnace growled.  He checked his watch one last time.  Disappointment flared across his face, then the planes shifted.  “Suite No. 2 in D minor,” he announced formally.

Embracing his cello prayerfully, he took a breath and became a monk kneeling on stones.

	The cello sang a brooding lyrical song, so personal in its soaring that it seemed as if Lewis were composing it.  Occasional false intonations and rough tones intensified the performance.  He announced each of the eight sections—“the Sarabande,” “now the Minuet”— all the rhythmically different dances united by the mournful cadences of D minor.  Hunching over his instrument like Casals in a cave, he played imperfectly and marvelously for Bach, for the three of them, and for himself.

	When he finished they applauded gently, preserving the spell.

	“No. 5?” Sten asked quietly.  “The other tragic suite?”

	“Why not,” Lewis said.

	The prelude was darker, more complex, the dotted rhythms of the dances transfiguring their origins.  He hummed, groaned, and sniffed, he rocked sideways, connecting beauty, ugliness, solitude.  He ended the Gigue with a flourish, his bow hovering over the dying tone.  Gloria, Sten, and Eva applauded in a trance, joined by shadows of a multitude.  Exhausted, Lewis pressed crackers and cheese on them.

Stories, stories.  Eva craved stories.  How did your grandparents die?  Who took care of you afterward?  Where did you get food?  Were you angry at your parents?  Was becoming an American child painful?  Occasionally, in anguish, he dredged up a memory—dogs tearing into a dead goat.

“You don’t know,” he sobbed.  “You’ll never know what it was like.”   His lips swelled and purpled; his expression collapsed like molten glass.

“I’m sorry,” she’d say, cradling his face.  “Don’t cry.  Please, Lewis.”

As a child she heard a noise like a choking dog coming from her parents’ room.  Peeking in, she saw her father face down across the bed in his work clothes, his back heaving.  He glanced at her, wiped his eyes on the pillow, and tugged an airmail card from under his chest.  “My mother is killed,” he said to the beyond of the card, to the sender, to his past.

No strategies kept Lewis from crying.  They could be discussing Plato, and out of the blue he would bury his face in her shoulder like a baby.  She made allowances for human nature, but this demand was too great, too self-absorbed.  Crying leaked into his sex drive.  He wanted to make love so he could enter her body and be consoled through her.  “I want you now,” he breathed, pressing on her with urgency greater than desire.  In the fire-lit boiler room he shoved her hand inside his pants.  “Do this for me,” he commanded, “if you won’t go all the way.”  From her overwrought sexual feelings came a vision of girls on their wedding nights in lace-trimmed satin nightgowns, sensing revulsion in their husbands’ passion, some tinge of cruelty or fear, and absorbing that revulsion along with the sex act and blaming themselves.

<center>§</center>

Nowadays, she thinks, love begins in coded language that rephrases the minuet of expectations and experience.  Emotions appear as emoticons.  Like love at first sight, computer attractions are narcissistic.  What happens when e-mail lovers encounter real smiles—do they flee back to their e-mail?

At a large dinner party earlier this summer she sat across the table from an academic computer programmer, a crisp athletic woman in her forties wearing a white linen blazer.  The woman said she had a wonderful e-mail relationship with a gentleman after she left her significant other of sixteen years.  She and the e-mail gentleman had a fling in New York, but the weekend was pthfft.  She had no word for it, just a thumbs-down Bronx cheer.  She wouldn’t even describe him.  Was he short and bald?  Did his breath smell of mint?  She only said the weekend was pthfft.  The gentleman was pthfft.  The vulgar sound spat from her prim mouth.  Candles glowed; the air was still and muggy.  Cream sauce congealed on their plates.  The conversation turned to separations.

Someone said, “Rich women don’t have to put up with shit.”

The computer programmer leaped in with a translation.  “Any woman with money will inevitably walk away from an unsatisfactory relationship.”

Eva said no—a wealthy friend of hers stayed married to an alcoholic.  “He was intolerable, but she loved him, so she remodeled the top floor and watched him trundle up every night hugging a whiskey bottle.”

The computer programmer said, “She was unable to come to terms with his inadequacies so she relegated him to another part of the house.”

Eva smiled politely.  She was a candle talking to a fluorescent bulb, a petunia conversing with a brick.  The brisk, redefining woman wouldn’t have cared if her breasts were different sizes; she would have played tennis and chosen interest groups on the Internet.  She would have mastered the art of displaying her smile with a parenthesis, she would wear electronic cosmetics.

Far down the table a drunk biologist said, “Maturity means taking possession of one’s life.”  I hope not, thought Eva, disliking the man’s double-chinned smugness.  Do people who get drunk on wine envy people who get drunk on life?

<center>§</center>
In college she translated herself into the world and got all A’s.  Writing papers in an abstract tongue, she sucked the juice out of philosophy and literature, turning a peach into something an astronaut could eat.  Existentialism fascinated her, she connected it with multiple personalities, with Morton Prince’s studies of Miss Beauchamp whose sprightliest self unraveled her knitting while she slept.  The idea of various selves inhabiting one body was intriguing, implying essence precedes existence, that people don’t change, they create variations on themes.

She and Lewis took each other home.  His parents were dull and shaggy, living in an apartment over the grocery.  Guilt leaked out of them.  They called him Lewie.  Mr. Backer wore a torn gray cardigan and scuffed shoes.  Mrs. Backer, gray hair escaping from a bun, worked silently at sink and stove, wearing an apron and chunky-heeled oxfords with white socks.  The radio played all weekend.  Mrs. Backer exchanged looks with her husband; Mr. Backer, painfully obsequious, kept his hands in his pockets.  Were they afraid of Lewis?  Of her?  They served meals and said little, as if under orders.

Her own family embraced him.  Daddy played all his Jan Peerce recordings.  Mama appreciated his sensitivity to the working class.

“Such a sweet boy,” Mama said behind his back, “so handsome and considerate.”

“And intelligent,” Daddy said, “and what talent—he sings, he plays cello, he acts, he writes poetry.”

When had they become so innocent and trusting, so eager?  Were they holding on to her, or giving her away?

  The two visits flickered like landscapes bitten by blind spots.  Lewis’s figure had ragged blanks like a Giotto fresco, with enough outline and color so she could fill the gaps.  He was all light and suggestion, secrets and hints.  Her imagination, like paint, filled the cracks in his crazed history, inventing details, making allowances.  Her mother, sewing a dress, made allowances for changing hemlines; her father made allowances for human nature.

Warnings came from all directions.  Lewis’s cello teacher said it was a crime he missed so many lessons.  A girl in his French class said his grammar and comprehension were terrible.  He was rude to her friends and had none of his own.  Her father sent newspaper clippings about dormitory fires.

Among the bleak prophets, only Jack, her friend from Trojan Women, managed to disturb her.  He loped to her table in the snack bar, smiling with lofty exaltation, like a boy displaying a big fish.

“You hear about Lewis?” he asked, straddling a chair.

“I wouldn’t know,” she said, doodling daisies in the margin of her notebook.

“About the whore in our dorm, I mean.”

A complex uneasiness rose up.  “You guys,” she said.

“It was weird.  I mean, they were lined up in the hall, mainly those goofball types like Ritchie.  Carrying towels.”

“Lewis was carrying a towel?”  She drew leaves on a stem.

“No, listen.  Ritchie said the room was dark ...”

“Whose room?”

“How should I know?  There was this girl in the top bunk sort of wrapped in a sheet and—Ritchie swears this is true, even though it was dark—he leaned close and it was Lewis.  He got out fast, but he didn’t say anything to the next guy in line—that’s the way it went.”

“Why do you make things up?”  Her heart pounded.  “Because I won’t go out with you?”

<i>“Truth unto its innermost parts,</i> Eva,” he said, quoting the school motto, and dismounted the chair.

What was he saying?  Lewis had a weird sense of humor?  He was gay?  Maybe it was a joke.  She didn’t know how to think about it.   Darkness surrounded homosexuality, like the darkness surrounding her father’s passage from Poland to America with another young man, a passage filled with terrors she supplied for him.  In high school she was infatuated with a fraternity guy who stopped calling her after they necked at a party and she felt rejected until one of his frat brothers said, “Don’t waste your breath, he’s a pansy.”  How could Lewis be the figure in the bed?  She made allowances.  Jack’s story dropped into the dark and nestled like a wormy potato alongside the story of her father journeying through Poland to Germany and reaching the sea.
<center>§</center>

Try telling that story today, she thinks.  People don’t believe she didn’t probe.  You’re in denial, they say, you must have probed, you just don’t remember—it’s not human nature to swallow a crazy story like that.  Well, she says, I met a man who said his father was in a concentration camp and I asked which one and he looked baffled and said, “I’m afraid I don’t know … I never asked.”
<center>§</center>

Jack took her out for pizza, they went for walks.  They’d adopted each other as brother and sister.  A fretful moralist, he often quoted the college motto.  But she walled off his opinions about Lewis.  An only child stubbornly follows her inner sense of direction.  Influence feels like coercion.

Jack said, “Someone’s been stealing books over in the dorm.”
The paths turned slushy, the wind blew, spring arrived.  Under a birch tree by the men’s dorm, wearing his ubiquitous yellow windbreaker, Lewis handed Eva a book, grinning happily.

She weighed it.  <i>A Textbook of Abnormal Psychology.  </i><br /><br />
“How come?” she asked.  The binding was red with black letters.  “I don’t know what I’d do with it,” she said.

“You’ve heard stories about me, right?” he shrieked, slashing his jacket zipper up and down.  “Jack tells you I steal!  Right?  Right?  Right?”  He fled into the dorm.

She kept the book, of course, and apologized for not thanking him.  She might even use it next year, she said, for advanced psychology—how thoughtful of him to buy it out of season.
<center>§</center>

She wonders about his other gifts: a leather-bound volume of Swinburne with marbled endpapers, inscribed in his florid handwriting; a bottle of Chanel #5 that lies in her sewing basket, still scented; and A History of the Blues with illustrations by Covarrubias.  He had a small allowance and no scholarship job.  Did she unknowingly accept stolen goods?

Mainly she remembers struggling with lust.

“If you don’t trust me enough to sleep with me,” he said, “I can’t bear to be in love with you.”

“If you can’t be stable and responsible,” she said, “I can’t trust you enough to sleep with you.”

The girls on their wedding nights, in their lacey nightgowns, crooked their fingers, falling backward on satin pillows, hair flowing, sighing, begging her to bend and suffer, to join their sisterhood of saints and nursemaids.  When resistance grew stale, she promised to “do it” on her birthday.
 <center>§</center>

Between promise and birthday they went to the Ides of March Ball, not to dance but to sit on bentwood chairs.  Lewis, in a white dinner jacket and bow tie, stubbornly crossed his arms and legs.  Eva, in black taffeta, envied girls in pink tulle waltzing with ordinary dates.

“Go ahead, dance with Jack,” Lewis said.  “Jackass Jack over there, mooning at you.”

“You shouldn’t have come if you wouldn’t at least try,” she said.  Did pop music violate his body rhythms?  Maybe dancing was too joyous.  Too exposed.

The band played “Slow Boat to China.”  He took her hand and stroked her fingers.  “They shot the goats,” he said calmly.  “Two soldiers.”

“What?” she whispered.

His words wavered into the music and drowned.  He talked as to himself, in a trance.  She leaned closer and heard, “man ... train ... touched me.”  She bent her ear to his mouth.

“Kids banded together,” he said.  “My job was stealing eggs.”

His memories bled into her.  Ragged children circled a brush fire, boiling eggs in a tin pot.  They stuffed berries in their mouths and squatted in bushes.  She saw boots and bayonets, heard planes and explosions.

The singer crooned, “Love you and keep you/In my arms evermore ....”  Couples swayed while he skipped from place to place, year to year, dispensing his terrible treasure. “I remember hearing Roosevelt say ....” he murmured.

“What?” she asked, stiffening.

“Roosevelt said ....”  The sentence blurred out.

She gripped his forearm, her jaw stony.  “How could you hear Roosevelt?  You weren’t here then.”

He leapt from his chair and charged through the dancers, arms flailing.  Beyond the dancers and the open door, the night yawned.  The singer crooned, “All by myself/Alone.”

She pushed through the crowd, self-conscious as a glass clock, and found him on the dark terrace, rocking on the top step, hugging his knees.

“You have no comprehension,” he sobbed bitterly.  “How can you have comprehension?”  His lips were swollen.  “On the wireless,” he said, “in the DP camp.”

<center>§</center>

Her students believe human nature changes with the decades.  They “have sex” in high school, mistaking lust for love.  Some are “into” S&M, straight or gay.  Some are casual consumers.  Some are numb already.

Listen to your voice, she tells young women.  Speak with your voice, act on your voice.  It may oppose or irritate, it may displease.  Trust your voice, trust all your voices.  Love someone, but listen.  Some people will call you selfish.  Masters and their agents will call you arrogant.  Resist them.  Resist the authority of the secret agent.  Love is not submission.  Pain is not glorious.

The S&M women smirk.  The casual consumers say sex is no big deal—freedom, free choice, that’s what sex is about.  Is she too serious?  Too limited?  Relying on anecdotal knowledge?  She understands, but doesn’t like, the display impulses of masochistic performance artists who hang naked from ropes for eight hours or stuff cucumbers into their vaginas.  Sexual politics—but what does it say about or do to the person?  She writes articles about the intricacies of family dynamics.  Is she too Messianic?  A fundamentalist?  Is that why she despises preachers?  Is truth-seeking a social value?  What about the exiled and disinherited?  The captives and fugitives?  Those at odds with their desires?

Pope Joan parading through Rome, about to give birth, surely sensed the personal about to merge with the historical.  Eva sensed it, the virgin on her nineteenth birthday, cleansed and apprehensive.  Her mother had informed her about menstruation; her father informed her about sex.  Years ago Mama declared at a dinner party, while ladling out spaghetti and meatballs,  “Listen Eva, I don’t expect you should be a virgin when you get married.  Or wash floors, either.”  Eva walked along a hot dusty road, hand in hand with her beloved, carrying a bag of sandwiches while Lewis carried a rolled blanket and a poetry anthology.  The ritual was not to be enacted on a wedding night, but on her birthday; her education wasn’t derived from the ministrations of village women, but from poring over <i>Sane Sex Life and Sane Sex Living</i>.  The woman <i>lies</i> under the man and <i>moves</i> her hips in a circle.  Italicized verbs insinuated themselves into hard vertical type.  She would not wave a bloodied bed sheet, although she did feel she’d been given away.

Lewis whistled, “La Ci Darem La Mano,” St. Johnswort bloomed, dust crept up the grass.  They turned into a little glade, spread out the blanket, and lunched on sandwiches, peaches, and milk.  They read Donne.  They kissed and took off their clothes.  Her lust evaporated.  Dutifully, like the generalized woman in <i>Sane Sex Life, </i> she lay on her back and he straddled her.  She closed her eyes and felt a knob, round and hard as a horse chestnut.  It felt incredibly personal.  At the same moment she heard a rustle in the grass and a little cough.  A few feet away a young boy was staring at them, very serious, very interested.  They screamed, he fled, and she laughed hysterically, hiccupping and rolling in the blanket among crumbs and peach pits while warm milk trickled down her thigh.  Lewis looked hopeful.

“It’s a bad omen,” she said, and pulled on her clothes.

They agreed to separate for the summer.  Lewis would learn the grocery business while she worked as a day camp counselor in the Catskills.  She suspected he auditioned for Tanglewood and failed the sight-reading.  Zits were blooming on his chin when they said goodbye.

At The National Hotel and Country Club the owner called every woman honey and every man champ.  Families sweated out the year’s frustrations by moving from dining-room chairs to lawn chairs to nightclub chairs.  Their kids hadn’t been ruined yet—the older ones were only twelve and still entertained by stories and games.  By fourteen they would be hyperactive with wants and terrifically discouraged: the girls would paint their nails and dye their hair; the boys would lose their coordination; they would pair off to neck and come home irritable.  But for now their imaginations sufficed.

Lewis sent long literary letters.  He was reading Thomas Mann and Camus and writing an existentialist epic.  Her heart pounded whenever she saw an envelope addressed in his florid hand, but the letters were disappointing—ideas omitted or in bad condition or in the wrong proportion.  A thought about free will ascended unattached, like steps with no porch.  His enthusiasm for Clavdia Chauchat made her suspect he’d skipped Hans Castorp’s conversations with Settembrini.

	One night the staff magician and his wife drove her to a cabin deep in the woods to meet their friends.  By the light of candles and kerosene lamps, exotically dressed people sat around a utility-spool table drinking wine from jelly jars.  They were entertainers—five married couples on the Catskill/Miami Beach circuit, their cheeks seamed like the cheeks of aging ballet dancers.  Eva sat on the floor, cradling a jelly jar, entranced.

“We’re wearing blue this year.”

“I start the Mae West impersonation stage left now.”

Every detail was holy—a new scarf, an extended joke, a differently placed foot.  They were monastic embroiderers sewing a single tapestry, devotedly counting stitches.  Their acts were their whole lives.

Without a letter to announce his coming, Lewis materialized by the volleyball court one morning like one of the magician’s grapefruits, hands in his yellow windbreaker, looking pale and disheveled.  “Aren’t you glad to see me?” he asked.

The volleyball game disintegrated.  Lewis dropped to the ground cross-legged.  He picked a long blade of grass and chewed it.  The children chanted, “Eva’s got a boyfriend,” and ran to him, leapfrogging and pummeling his back.  He managed to quiet them by improvising a story about a Monarch and a Yellowjacket.  He should give up epics, she thought, and write a children’s book.  He helped with the children all day, a strained smile etched in his face.  After supper they took a walk, hand in hand on the hotel grounds.

“Where are you staying?” she asked.  “Do you have money?  I wish I could put you up.”  His nails were long; he hadn’t been practicing.

“Don’t you worry,” he said, suddenly belligerent.  “I can take care of myself.”

They kissed goodnight and he receded down the dusty road, hands in his pockets and head bent, kicking pebbles.  In the curve of his neck and the droop of his shoulders was a privacy she didn’t trust, something that spoke of managing in an unwholesome way.  The things he did alone, the parts of him that were unknown, seemed not simply unknown but sinister.  She sensed it in the turning away, the turning toward someplace else—not because it excluded her, but because of who he might be when she wasn’t looking.  Sadness leaked off his spine, off his walk: a swagger, a child’s bravado, hands in pockets and feet splayed in an old man’s brogues.

Years later she wrote in a letter or a dream or a journal:

<i>How can I undo the done-done?  The done-done, the dun-dun.  How<br /> can I undo?  How can we ever?  What was done was done, <br /> the done-done.  How can we undo the done-done?  Bleakness <br />hovers beyond the edge of a bed, up in the attic where big and small <br />swim at me.  Evil touches us, we are not evil.  We do not attract evil. <br />  It arrives.  We are innocent.  We are good.  But something, <br />something.  Some things are done.  How can we undo the done-done? </i><br /><br />
The next day Lewis undid the latch to her bunkroom.  She undid her halter top.  He undid his pants and she undid her shorts.  Together they undid their relationship.  He lay on top of her on the narrow cot in the converted barn she shared with three women.  Motes shimmered in beams of sunlight filtering through cracked wood.  She felt that personal knob.  Then the door rattled and a roommate shouted she had to pee and they scrambled into their clothes and Lewis scooted up a ladder to the rafters like the surprised lover in a restoration comedy.

In a little grove, protected by shrubs, they sat apart, cross-legged, fingers curled upward in weary abdication.  “It’s a bad omen,” she said.  And they broke up.

Women are bilingual, she teaches.  We learn male syntax while encoding our own.  Some of us hold both languages simultaneously; we speak directionally and think in clusters, having the cleverness of slum children who learn mental agility by side-stepping rats.  Leaping from cause to effect, scooting here, then there, we courteously explain routes which differ coming and going.

Being out of love was terrible.  She sat under a pine tree in the rain and scratched poems in the wet earth until the tips of her nails pulled away.  A hole gaped in her throat while her lips continued their parting streams of words and smiles.  She didn’t see Lewis—their paths literally didn’t cross—but notes appeared in her mailbox like letters from the grave.

“I’d rather screw a fish.”

“If you fall in love with Jack, you’ll die.”

Each envelope was addressed in a different hand, each note written on different stationery.  Tacks and splinters littered the air.  She dreaded opening her mailbox.

During the winter she sang mournful Schubert songs accompanied by her former roommate’s old boyfriend, the sexually ambiguous Swedish alcoholic.  He played badly, she sang badly; together they made despairing music.  He’d lost his black overcoat and had only a tweed jacket and scarf.  Tormented, he drowned in vodka and she drowned in music.

	In late spring she was reading on her dorm bed when Liz from next door came in without knocking.  Liz was a muckraker with infallible sources, sure to be a great journalist.  Spare and direct, she talked out of the side of her mouth and had a mustache.  She plopped on a chair and stretched her legs.

	“Got something to tell you,” she said gruffly.

	Another theft in the dorm?  Another silent assembly while they guiltily waited for the thief to confess?

	Liz cleared her throat.  “Lewis.”  She looked up from under thick black eyebrows.  “Know where he grew up?”

“What?”

“Do you know where Lewis is from?”

	“Alsace-Lorraine.  Everybody knows that.”

Liz glowered at her.  “He isn’t,” she said.

“Technically not, but ....”

	“Never left New Jersey,” Liz said.  “Born in Jersey City, moved to Passaic.”

	Eva closed her eyes.  A pyramid shimmered in sand dunes.   “That’s impossible,” she said, keeping it up.

	“Sorry.”

Eva looked out the window.  Sun on stone.  “Thank you, Liz,” she said.

“Well,” Liz said, standing and brushing her jeans as if they’d accumulated dust, “now you know.  See you around.”  Flashing a crooked smile, she patted Eva’s shoulder and left, closing the door gently behind her.

The pyramid burst.  Pale blocks, light as Styrofoam, floated down and settled in the sand.  She would have hugged Liz if she could, for setting her free.


She saw Lewis in the fall, sitting on the hill below the library, books tumbled beside him.  His hair was dull and messy.  Eva walked up the hill slowly, crossing a great distance, and sat beside him, dropping her books.

	“Hello, Lewis,” she said softly.

	He looked at her speculatively with those green eyes, a bit troubled, a bit harsh.

	“Liz told me,” she said, as if they were in the middle of a conversation, “you’ve always lived in New Jersey.”  They looked at each other.  She felt distant and cool, a lawyer waiting for her client to speak.  He tossed his head.

	“Yeah,” he said.

	The one word was shocking.

	“What’ve you been doing?” she asked.

	He looked down, plucking grass by the roots with thumb and forefinger.  “Oh, seeing an analyst.  Don’t know if it’s doing much good.”

	He had a nasal tenor, a New Jersey twang.

	“I liked your other voice better,” she said cautiously.

	“Yeah,” he said.

	She waited a few beats before asking, “Why?”

	He combed the grass with his fingers.  “Well ... I wanted to impress you.”  He winced.  “The accent came in a flash.  I thought of saying, whoa, it’s all a joke, but then I thought, tomorrow I’ll do it.  And then somehow I created a person and you fell in love with him, so I had to keep it up because I knew damn well you’d never be interested ... you’d never love the real Lewis Backer.  You needed somebody exotic.”  His accusation soared bitterly, triumphantly.  Then he crumpled.  “I don’t see how you went on believing me.  Nobody else did.”

	“I always believe people,” she said.  “Is that a fault?”  His accusation stung; she hadn’t considered herself an accomplice.  “You took advantage of me.”

	“My analyst says you need illusion.”

	It was her turn to pluck grass.  “What else does your analyst say?”

	“I’m a pathological liar.”

	He looked despondent and very young, his cheekbones like razorblades.  Did having a name for his condition—she didn’t want to say illness— console him?

	She searched his face.  “Tell me ... when we visited your parents.  How did you ever get away with the accent?”

	“Oh, they never notice anything.”

	“They must have noticed something ....”

	He shriveled.  “Sometimes I was Italian for a couple months, sometimes French.  From foreign language broadcasts—it was fun sitting at the table being anything.  They’re such losers.”   His eyes filled with trouble, his lips swelled.  Truth reduced him to skin and bones.  “You don’t like me, do you?”

	“You’re more ... ordinary.  I’m sorry.”

	He snorted.  “It’s OK.  It’s a relief to be ordinary.  I didn’t know if I was coming or going.  My head was screwed on backward.”  He snorted again.

	“Oh, God, of course ... keeping your story straight ... it must have been awful, worrying all the time who you told what.”

	He looked surprised.  “No,” he said thoughtfully, “that wasn’t the problem.  I knew the details ...”  He gave her a friendly relaxed smile, hinting at renewal.

	She glimpsed him limping in a quagmire of lies and strategies.  Isolating himself.  Night after night after being with her, when he closed the door and was alone, how did he feel?  Did he loathe himself?  Was he exhilarated?

She bit her tongue.

“I hear you have a new boyfriend,” he said reproachfully.

“We live off campus,” she said.  “Not together.”

	They sat for a while, plucking grass.  Eva gathered her books and stood up.

	“See you around,” he said, shielding his eyes.

“See you around,” she said.  From the library she looked back.  The scene etched itself in her memory with the acids of her complicity—trees and paths, people crossing in light-colored clothes, the distant bell tower, ivy-covered buildings, the slope gently rising, and Lewis in a wrinkled white shirt, books tumbled beside him, his back curved in despair, methodically plucking grass.

<center>§</center>

Eva dreams the island dry goods store was remodeled.  It extends to the top of the building and perhaps beyond.  The walls and ceiling are white, light streams through clerestory windows.  The center of the ceiling is the underside of a widow’s walk, and all the moldings are delicately carved.  She gasps as if she’d entered the cathedral of Notre Dame.

She sets a long molding and hinge on the counter to return them.  The owner stands by an ornate antique cash register.  He’s tall and ironic, with a thin face and white hair combed back from his forehead.  He wears a red-and-black checked flannel shirt.  She asks for a refund and he gives it to her in dollar bills, one at a time, turning again and again to the cash register, light on his feet because he used to be an Arthur Murray dance instructor.  There’s a gracious distance between them.  He gives her too much money, twenty dollars so far.  The price tag on the molding says twelve dollars; she can’t see the price on the hinge but she’s sure it’s less.  He doesn’t owe her so much.  She opens her mouth to object, but he continues to give and she continues to take.  Her wallet bulges, she can’t close it; she drops it in her purse.  He gives her coffee in a Styrofoam cup.

She wakes, oddly content, remembering the light, the whiteness, the perfect proportions, her awe, and his awkward, gracious generosity.
