<i>Worrying is an ironic form of hope.<br />
		     			         —Adam Phillips</i><br /><br />

<i>Exposing the Heart</i><br /><br />
Mama lies on the examination table, half  naked, enduring a cardiogram.  Her breasts flop to the sides.  She fed me with those breasts, but she’s prudish and has hidden them ever since.  They’re surprisingly young and fresh, like risen bread dough.

Her mouth twitches with disapproval.

A yoke settles on my shoulders.  I sit on a gray metal stool, facing her old age.  I’m an only child; I live eight hundred miles away.  We visit each other once or twice a year and phone every Sunday.  But she’s eighty-four.  Her head feels heavy, her stomach hurts.  Cancer, she thinks, but won’t say it.  Still, she doesn’t accept old age—she’s preparing for hip replacement, which is why I’m here, being a good daughter. Her orthopedist is a Top Man and surgery is in three months.  “No pain, no cane,” he promises; “heels again with skirts.”  I’ll be back.  My aunt Dinah handed me the job—apologizing, clearing her throat—ashamed she’s gotten too old.  We wish Mama would let well enough alone.

The doctor dashes in, a tall charismatic Russian with curly hair and a strong accent.  Mama chose him because his clinic is in walking distance, with two nurses and a receptionist.  Also he’s a Concerned Doctor, known to make house calls and cry at his patients’ funerals.

He begins his exam.  Her mouth twitches—her daughter seeing her like this, poked and kneaded, the doctor’s inquisitive hands squeezing her stomach.  Deftly he draws out her ailments, jotting everything on a pad.  She tries to cooperate, but whenever she adds a new complaint he cries in mock despair, “Why you didn’t tell me that?”

He asks if her feet hurt; she says her teeth fit all right.  “Just like a woman,” he says, laughing flirtatiously, “always confused.”  She laughs too, as if she’s been flattered.

He tells her to sit up straight; she lies back.  “Just like a woman,” he says, “always wanting to lie down.”

“Speak louder,” I say dryly, “she’s hard of hearing.”

He takes her blood pressure and frowns.

“We take picture of her heart,” he tells me conspiratorially, “she’s hypertensive.  Outside, down steps, on your right.”

Outside?  In the rain?  Surprisingly meek, Mama puts her coat over the hospital gown, ties her plastic kerchief tightly, and out we go, down a steep flight of wet cement steps to a door labeled Podiatrist.

A young Chinese man sits at a desk in a bare room.  He brightens.  There’s an ultrasound monitor on the desk and controls on the floor.  I help Mama lie on her side on the examining table.  The technician kicks the control box and the monitor wakes up.  He touches Mama’s chest with a metal wand.

Her heart appears on the screen in black-and-white—a furry, pulsing little animal.  Mama is so sealed, it’s miraculous, seeing deeply into her.  I bend forward, shoulder to shoulder with the technician.  He chats companionably about thickness of heart walls and calcium deposits.  Fuzzy valves open and close; I see throbs and luminous deposits from front and lateral angles.  My mother’s heart is a distinct living creature, her essence.

“Good pulse,” the technician says.

I raise my eyes to her, curled in fetal position, the wand gliding stealthily under her breast.  Her face is stony.  What does she feel?  I go close.

“Your heart is very strong,” I say loudly.

She looks up, glazed and uncomprehending.

I repeat, louder, “Your heart is very strong.”

“Sure, sure,” she mutters furiously. “The X-rays are killing me.”

“They aren’t X-rays!” I cry.  “It’s sound!  The wand is a microphone!”

But Mama’s first impressions last forever.  The damage is done.

We trudge upstairs.  She gets dressed.

In the doctor’s office, with its fine wood and Turkistan carpet, she sits erect and inscrutable, like a sphinx.  He refuses to address her directly, so I have to translate.  Head heavy, stomach not good—nothing to worry about; high blood pressure—very serious.

 “Her old medicine is no good,” he says.  “She must take new one.”  He slides samples across the desk.

Graciously, Mama says her old medicine agrees with her.

He leans forward, exasperated.  “You think I’m not smart?” he shouts.

Her mouth twitches.

Does he shame all his patients?  The difficult ones?  The women?

Rising, he dismisses her with the smile one might give a lovely irritating child.  We shake hands.  The look he gives me seems to say, you’re attractive, but I like my women docile.

Mama and I walk slowly, arm in arm, down the tree-lined street.  Rain patters on the umbrella.

“Such a thorough examination,” she says, “all in one appointment.”
I say nothing.  We walk.

“He should have taken my pressure a few more times,” she says.  “New medicine—who needs new medicine.”

I mention the heart deposits.  She pulls away angrily.

“You understand all that,” she grumbles, “You could have been anything, even a doctor.”

<i>Anxiety</i><br /><br />
All summer, on a small Maine island, I deal with Mama’s health and deafness on a phone outside the village post office.  Her fear is blooming into tumors.

“What did you learn from the CAT scan?” I shout.

“Listen,” she says, “I swallowed the whole time and something moved in my head … listen … I’m swallowing … something is moving in my head.  They didn’t get a good picture.”

“It’s probably nothing,” I shout, “I’d be scared of surgery too.”

“Don’t talk to me about surgery, please,” she says.  “My stomach is terrible.  They don’t operate on a sick woman.”

People stop me on the road to ask about her headaches and constipation.  A stranger asks if she’s still displacing anxiety.

She grows calmer as the date approaches.  “If I die, I die,” she grumbles, “if I go blind, I go blind.”

This won’t be any picnic, my father would have said.  Pessimism is Mama’s rock and redeemer.  She doesn’t lift her eyes unto the hills whence cometh the Lord; she examines a heap of string beans and selects one at a time.  Religion, she says, will help you as much as blood-letting a corpse.

But religion sticks; everlastingness has mutated.  Anyone who’s late for supper is dead; if she misplaces her wallet, it’s lost forever.  Waking and sleeping she cries, Oy vey’s mir—that existential cry of suffering.  But when ailments multiply she cries, Oy vey’s ts’mir (so much meaning in that little ts)—suffering comes to me, I’m in big trouble, life itself is against me.

Whenever I phone she cries, “What’s the matter?”

She can devastate me.  I stayed two weeks after my stepfather’s death, my only release a bus ride to the funeral parlor for the death certificate.  The day before leaving I brought out photo albums to cheer her up.  She sat at the table, head propped on her fist, eyes dull.  Suddenly she shrieked, “Tomorrow I’m going to stay in bed and never get up!”

I woke in the middle of the night unable to pee.  My bladder filled; the sphincter held its cramp.  Hours passed.  I phoned a hospital, but the emergency room was full.  At dawn Mama phoned Dinah, hysterical—not that I was in pain, but that I locked the bathroom door.  The woman who gave me life can kill me, I thought.  Determined to catch the plane, I waddled up the block to a doctor’s clinic.  The trauma lingers.

<i>Control </i><br /><br />
Mama talks to herself in the full-length mirror, fingertips in her pockets, lips pursed.  “Maybe the blue top goes better with the beige pants,” she says.

“Enough already,” Dinah says, clearing her throat, “you look okay, it’s a hospital not a party.”

One last critical look and Mama takes her cane off the doorknob.  She hands me a ragged scrap of paper with scribbled phone numbers: her burial society and the funeral home.  Herbert, my husband, picks up her suitcase.  She takes my arm and we walk up the driveway, greeting neighbors out to wish her luck.  Before getting in the cab she looks me up and down.

“Your pants are baggy,” she says.

This is no time to argue.

Corpse-like figures moan, webbed in tubes and morphine pumps.  Recovery room nurses scurry from bed to bed.  Visitors wear yellow scrub gowns.

Mama stares upward dully.  That small body has been cut, that tender flesh.

“I can’t feel my legs,” she says in a deep husky voice.  Her teeth are out and her mouth is dry.  In anguish, I moisten her lips and stroke her papery cheek.

“I’m getting hunger pains,” she mutters. “Oy vey’s mir, it’s no good.”  She sleeps.

I return at six o’clock.  Incredible.  She’s holding tight to her glaucoma bottle and consulting her watch.

“How are your legs?” I ask.

She squints at my yellow scrub gown.

“What kind of a top is that?” she asks.

Mama’s room is a small double, her IV stand jammed between her bed and two metal lockers, a morphine pump within reach.  Her color is good.  She grumbles, “The apple juice has no taste … I should be walking already … too many cardiograms and blood tests.”  Drifts off.  Wakes.  Blows into a blue lucite box to clear her lungs.  Tries to raise three balls.  Raises one ball and grumbles she’s a failure.  Raises two balls, but isn’t looking.

The  post-op floor has an anxious, military atmosphere, like boot camp, its purpose conveyed by iron beds, hip chairs, and white compression stockings.  Iron grab bars dangle from arching iron rails.  The hip chairs, adult highchairs, line the walls.  Everyone wears those white stockings.

Mama’s roommate, a real estate agent, conducts business with visitors wearing a garish floral silk bathrobe.

Mama sleeps.  I write in my journal.  I have no name here, no separate identity.  It’s restful being nameless, being Mrs. Mintz’s daughter.  Which is how I’m called to the phone.  An internist informs me that yesterday, during surgery, my mother had a “cardiac event” and a cardiologist is on his way.

The fall.  The dreaded fall.  I expected to phone Dinah tonight and say all is well, we can relax.  Poor Mama.  Counting the cost of every pleasure, she suffers losses when she improves her life.  She went to a doctor with an earache and came home deaf.  She bought a superior sandal and broke her hip.  She replaced the roof and it developed a leak.  Perhaps if the doctor knew she’d had typhoid as a child he wouldn’t have washed her eardrum.  Perhaps if she hadn’t lost her temper she wouldn’t have stubbed her sandal on a broken sidewalk.  And she probably hired a cut-rate roofer.  Still, Mama and the universe seem savagely balanced.  Does she pay for living narrowly in the present?  For living without faith or hope?  In a life of such cosmic exactitude is a weakened heart the price of a new hip?

The curtain is pulled around the bed.  The cardiologist and I stand on opposite sides.  He studies his clipboard.  Very tall and confident, with an imposing walrus mustache.  One quick look at him and Mama’s mouth twitches.
“She’s hard of hearing,” I say.

“I don’t want to raise my voice,” he says flatly, and itemizes the damage like an insurance adjuster.  I translate quickly.

“You had a strain on your heart during surgery,” I shout.

“Oy vey’s ts’mir,” she says.

“Look at it this way,” he says suavely, “she took a stress test and failed.”
“It’s not serious,” I shout.

Mama’s eyes glaze like dead minnows and her hearing shuts down.  “My heart was good,” she says hoarsely.

“No problem,” he continues, “she’ll just take medication the rest of her life.”

I soften the doctor’s words.  “Probably you’ll have to take some medication,” I shout.

“Definitely,” he shouts.

“Oy vey’s ts’mir,” she says.

Visiting hours end.  Mama sinks into her pillows, glaring furiously.

“Go home,” she orders, “go eat supper, I’m all right.”

It’s hard to breathe.  Wings beat in my chest.  Am I leaving her to die in the night?  Black-spotted lilies pollute the foyer outside my brother-and-sister-in-law’s apartment.  Inside, surrounded by huge oriental sculptures, everyone seems frozen, suspended—Herbert, his brother Eric and wife Barbara, and two cousins visiting from abroad.  Cardiogram numbers chase each other round and round.  Herbert takes one quick look and somehow I’m in a chair, someone has brought a beer.  The family, usually politely distant, laps me in attention and, for once, I talk.

Our cousin’s dark eyes are mournful; he’s a hematologist, his patients die of leukemia. “The cardiogram figures are fine,” he says, “your mother didn’t have a heart attack.”

“The bastards,” Eric says fiercely, “they’re practicing defensive medicine.”  My brother-in-law is a CEO and a marathon runner; he maintains a log of his blood pressure and uses the data to cow his doctor.

“Tomorrow ask about enzymes,” says our cousin’s wife.

Eric leans forward and taps my knee.  “Her doctor is playing by the rules,” he scoffs.  “Don’t take the guy seriously.  Listen, let me tell you a story.”  He sits back and smiles with great relish.  “I have a cardiologist, a hotshot by the name of _____.”

“That’s who it was,” I say, “the doctor who saw Mama.”

Mama is alone, her bed moved to the window.  She looks pale and shrunken.  All night she had chest pains and tests—the tumult drove out her roommate.  Mercifully her hiatus hernia was acting up, not her heart.

“I’m my own worst enemy,” she says hoarsely.  “I go in a healthy woman and come out sick.  What did I need an operation for?  I’m worse than I was before.  Medicine the rest of my life—I shouldn’t have to take medicine.”

How do I fight for her?  How do I quickly manipulate the system? I visualize the hospital as a royal court, wigged courtiers bowing and scheming in a paranoid hierarchy.

I stand by the nurses’ station, channeling Katharine Hepburn. The cardiologist strides down the corridor, on his rounds.

“Good afternoon, doctor,” I say brightly. “I don’t think I told you my name.”  I pronounce it clearly, aiming my last name, striking him with my brother-in-law.

An anxious boy with a walrus mustache peers at me.  “His wife?” he asks.

“Sister-in-law.”

“He’s ... ah ... very smart.”  A slight bow.  “I guess everybody says that.”

“You mean difficult.”

He laughs uneasily.  For one wicked moment I enjoy reflected power.  “You scared my mother half to death last night,” I say.  “You overdid it.”

He dances a side-step, muttering about the old days and the new—about withholding information and telling.  We head for Mama’s room.

“What you need to do is establish your own relationship with her,” I say.  “No translations.  Just go in there alone and downplay everything.”  As he strides across the threshold I pat his arm.

He’s a quick study.  I hear him roar paternally, “I’ve given you a strong medicine for your hernia.”

“A strong medicine?” she croaks.

“Ah ... a good medicine,” he says.

Roses on the windowsill; Mama doesn’t notice.  While the internist explains her progress, I take notes.  I’ve told him I’m reporting to a distinguished hematologist in the family.

“Listen, Norma,” Mama says, “I have something important to tell you.”

“CK elevated weakly positive, 2 to 4 percent,” the internist says.  I scribble, repeating it aloud.

“Listen, Norma,” Mama says, “I have something important to tell you.”  I swallow irritation.  “Listen, Norma,” she says, beckoning with a finger.

Controlling the doctors is easy; being a daughter is hard.  Near the end of my first pregnancy I was flapping a blanket across the bed when the room dimmed and Mama’s face, like a huge balloon, rose ominously from the mattress to the ceiling.  “No,” I screamed, warding her off, “no!”

In old photos she’s a pretty, round-faced young woman.  Did I run to her for comfort?  Did I hug her leg as I hugged my father’s?

Last night, walking home after dinner, I linked arms with Mati, the hematologist.  He and his parents survived Nazi deportations in a peasant’s root cellar.  He was four.  “The year you lived in the hole,” I asked, “which of your parents did you mainly depend on?”

“Both equally,” he said with deep feeling.

“I’ve always depended on Mama’s love,” I said, “but help or protection?  I can’t even imagine it.”

I dreamed about a sandy hole.  Refugees on a hot dusty road.  A crossroads with a sandpit.  Mati kneeling face down in the sand, wheeling round and round, face buried, smothering.  Smothering, mothering.

Listen, Norma, I have something important to tell you.

I recoil, have always recoiled.  Keep a loving distance and wait for trouble to pass.  Follow my own line, stick to the long view.  Pay attention.  Give Mama credit where credit is due.  Resist her turbulence.

It’s exhausting.

Mama dozes.  I massage her feet in the compression stockings, flex and separate her toes, rotate her ankles.  Her right knee is purple.  Higher up, under her gown, both legs are swollen and hard, a bit glossy, like doll plastic.  A catheter snakes across her thigh.  It emerges from a slitted mound, nearly hairless and softly rounded, like a turkey breast.  So young, a young girl.  My mother.  The deepest, most private view, deeper than her heart beating in a
sonogram or her breasts flanked by electrodes.  I hold her foot in both hands; I can’t let go of her foot.  I look at this mound, simple and mysterious as an egg.  The slit is so familiar, so ordinary.  There it is, the opening through which I was born.

Dancers and cooks, salesmen and socialites—in the corridor everyone’s dignity adjusts to walkers and canes, to bathrobes, compression stockings, and sturdy shoes.  Mama is taking her first walk, tethered to an IV stand.  Chin high, back straight, looking dreamy, she sings Cherubino’s aria, “Voi che sapete,” swinging her walker to the beat.  A nurse calls out, “Someone’s feeling good.”  Mama chuckles, shakes her shoulders, and pretends to run.

She’s turning into a plucky patient, after all.  A nurse maneuvers her into a hip chair and we study tomorrow’s menu.

“The roast beef could be tough,” she says.  “The hamburger could be lumpy.”  She touches her hip.  “I shouldn’t have any pain.”

“You just had surgery,” I say, tensing again.

“What are you talking about?” she snaps.  “I should be in therapy already.”

The commandments have mutated, too.  Thou shalt has become I should; Thou shalt not has become I shouldn’t.  Life fails its obligations to her; she smolders with moral indignation.  For now she has faith in the Top Man’s holy promise, “no pain, no cane.”  Can it last?

When I return from lunch, a new roommate—Thelma, fat and balding, wearing a pink chiffon night set—is unwrapping the introductory turkey sandwich.  She waits alone for hip replacement, her second, no children to keep her company.  Mama likes her.

“You can die in these operations,” Thelma says, “or you can lose your hearing aid.”  I tell her my mother’s hearing aid survived.  “I’m so afraid of being shut out,” she whimpers.

United by deafness, the same surgeon, and a caustic attitude, Mama and Thelma discuss lunch.

“My chicken had too much fat!” Mama shouts.

“My turkey was too dry!” Thelma shouts.

“The applesauce is terrible!”

“The ice cream is terrible!”

“She looks much older than me,” Mama says confidentially, “and she’s only seventy-eight.”

Thelma says her husband came out of the nursing home yesterday after a serious illness.  She sinks into a long phone conversation with him.  Did he eat his toast?  Did he nap all right?  She cradles the phone, leaning into it as if it were flesh.  “I wish you could be with me today, Henry, I really do,” she says sadly, tenderly.  “I hope I’ll be out of here so we can spend some more years together, Henry.”

I kiss Mama goodbye and kiss Thelma, too.

From my bedroom window I look down at shiny black streets and umbrellas.  Cabs converge at Lincoln Center.  The Metropolitan Opera’s glamorous marble facade rises to a flat tarred roof, like a shopping mall.

I phone a friend’s mother who just had hip replacement in a different hospital.  She used to be a doctor and although her mind is fading her social graces are intact.  “We’ll just have to carry on right through the winter, won’t we,” she begins, in her warm, practical voice.  I assure her we will, and follow her into the past where people visit and the orchard suffers blight.  Suddenly her short term memory wakes up and her granddaughter passes exams with flying colors and she herself makes a good try at walking from the bed to the door, all clear and detailed, and after she tires of that reality she slides into the past again and has trouble slicing beans and the weather turns cold.

Thelma’s bed stands empty, its sheets fresh, her clothes gone.  Henry died in the night.  If only he’d died two hours later, the nurses say, she would have had her new hip.  But imagine waking up to that, Mama says.

“Awful what happened to Thelma,” Mama’s surgeon says, “she was so devoted.” And that’s it for Thelma.  He stands at the foot of the bed, swaying from the rail as if he were on the subway.  He’s on his way to England to lecture at Oxford.  Mama tells him I’m a writer.  He says his nine-year-old son writes haiku, he never thought a son of his would write poetry.  Mama recites a rhyme I made up when I was four and urges me to sing.  I consider hiding under the radiator.

“Doctor,” she asks graciously, “why does my hip hurt?”

“You won’t have any pain, don’t worry, no pain.”

“But it hurts, doctor.”

“No pain,” he says smoothly.

Her mouth twitches.  “How soon can I walk without the cane?”

“If you should have balance problems you’ll need the cane outdoors.”

Recovery is taking longer than he thought, he says, but she’s doing fine—another week in the hospital—let’s say till Saturday.  He engages me in a discussion of Philip Glass and John Adams.

My heart sinks.  Another week.  Is it true that people with negative attitudes heal more slowly?

“You should have sung for him,” Mama says after he leaves, her face glowing with pride that her daughter and her surgeon have so much in common.  “A folk song, even.”  Her expression collapses.  “Before the operation he said ‘no pain, no cane.’  Now he says I might be a cripple. Oy vey’s mir.”

The physical therapist arrives, a cheerleader type.  She helps Mama to her feet.

“How will I get to Florida?” Mama wails, the present rolling into the future.  “How will I shop?  How will I put on my shoes?”

“You’re ahead of yourself!” the therapist shouts merrily in her ear.

I, also, had unreal expectations.

I imagined times when Mama would sleep or read.  I imagined walks along the river.  I imagined Mama and Dinah uncorking childhood stories.

So far I’ve written five picture postcards.  My lunch break shrinks because she forces her leftovers on me.  The noose tightens.  I go to the café for yogurt and return immediately.  I drill her leg exercises, walk her to the bathroom, walk her up and down the corridor, take her to the solarium, take her to therapy.  I bring ice water, the tooth cup, and endless tubs of vitamin pudding.

We reminisce and chat.  Talk, talk, constant talk.  Listen, Norma.  Every ache inspires her.  Varicose veins: “It never hurt before.”  Hemorrhoids: “I hope I don’t need surgery.”

“Listen, Norma, I have something very important to tell you.  Listen, what’s a muscle?  Is it flesh or maybe bone?”

Did Thelma phone Henry again?  Or was that their last conversation?

Bad night.  Grouchy mood.  Refuses painkillers.  Stares at food with a stubborn, petulant expression.  Refuses to eat.

A nap would help, but like a cranky child she invents activities.

I roll down the bed and fluff her pillows.  She looks up thoughtfully, her eyes clear.  “Of course you love me,” she says, following some internal argument.  “You want me to feel well; you want me to feel well.  You don’t want to lose your Mama.  You want to have a Mama.”

A subtle reproach.  A pip of resentment she carries, about being needed.

Childhood skipped Mama.  Bombs fell.  German and Russian soldiers arrived in alternating waves.  The family was hungry.  They hid the landlord’s daughter so she wouldn’t be raped.

My father suffered the same hardships.  But after his cancer operation he wrote a hymn to life, celebrating nurses, doctors, janitors, a sunlit tree, and his hope for a new day.  In a brief half year of new days he never grumbled.

Still, Mama’s subtle reproach satisfies, like hot pepper, nudging me out of her negative orbit.

<i>Killing Pain</i><br /><br />
My soul mates, my sisters in servitude, are the private nurses, beautiful Caribbean women with the sad elegance of princesses fallen on hard times.  My practical allies are the staff nurses.  One shows me a gorgeous amber necklace from her lover, a married doctor; another shows me photos of fourteen grandchildren she supports.  Most have undergone surgery; they’re the caregivers, the healers—humans among humans.  The surgeons, the aristocrats, create Tin Woodsmen, skillfully replacing hips, knees, elbows, even fingers and toes.  Majestic and inscrutable, masters of their trade, they address the singular and narrow.  “The femoral bone was collapsed and lost its blood supply.”  “The incision looks good.  “In two months you’ll forget all this.”

In the elevator I finally see a woman doctor.  “Is this hospital prejudiced,” I ask, “or are women orthopedic surgeons in short supply?”

She laughs bitterly.  “They have some catching up to do here,” she says.  And gets off at pediatrics.

Herbert has returned home, to Illinois, to teach.  Mornings I hang out with Barbara and write in my journal.  At noon I take the M72 to the hospital and stay till seven.  If Mama happens to doze off in the solarium I get to talk to other people, mainly the long-timers: a brassy Southern woman with one leg, an elderly government attorney with edema, a young cook in a wheelchair.  Dinah faithfully makes the long journey from Sheepshead Bay two or three afternoons a week.  In the evenings Eric, Barbara, and I have dinner; my son Yuri and his girlfriend occasionally join us from Brooklyn after work.  This period, with its escapes, will seem like paradise when Mama and I are imprisoned in her small apartment.

Maneuvering down the hall with two canes, Mama glares jealously at her fellow travelers.  She’s wearing her old purple and white nylon housecoat.

“They don’t have pain,” she grumbles.  “Only me.”

Her pessimism is refining itself, placing her right up there with Thomas Hardy and Woody Allen.  Here we are in a hospital formerly named “The Society for the Ruptured and the Crippled.”  Illnesses on this floor alone include rheumatoid arthritis, congenital displacement, angina, and bone cancer.  And she truly believes she is the only one with pain.  It’s almost endearing.  The more she improves, the more she wears self-lacerating comparisons like armor, her lamentations protecting her from worse calamity.  If she opens a chink of satisfaction, God will strike her dead through the crack.

One of her ex-roommates limps toward us, leaning heavily on two canes, wearing a lavender silk bathrobe and running shoes.

“How are you, Christine?” Mama asks with polite skepticism.  “How do you feel?”  This is Woody Allen interviewing the Little Mermaid.

Christine’s father’s smoking gave her asthma which required Prednisone which caused arthritis of the hip.  Married, but unable to have children, she does crafts at home, dependent on an oxygen tank.  Even after hip replacement her leg is twisted.

“I feel great,” she says. “The Man Upstairs took good care of me.”  She pats Mama’s arm, laughs merrily, and slowly limps toward the solarium.

“You see that?” Mama says, satisfied.  “She doesn’t have any pain.”

I swallow my arguments and catch Christine alone.  “Any pain?” I ask.

“Not a bit,” she says cheerily.  “Oh, the incision and the muscles hurt like hell, but the old hip pain is gone.  Hey, compared to that, this is a piece of cake.”

Mama scorns mental attitudes.  “You see,” she preaches, “people don’t have these operations unless they can’t walk.  I walked fine.  I’m much worse off than before.”

Wearing lipstick today, Mama introduces herself to women in the solarium, exchanging information about pain and swelling and telling them how to get better meals.  She wears her pink velour robe and leans lightly on one cane.  Her eyes are wide open, sparkling with curiosity.  She’s interested in boats on the  river and wonders what sort of people patronize the floating restaurant anchored below.

How sweetly, painfully familiar she is.  How charming.  I’d forgotten the Mama of my childhood who was politically active and had friends.  She had a comical side, was lively and flexible.  This is my first good look at the miracle operation everyone talks about, the new lease on life she was promised.  She even hears better.

Washing her denture cup in the sink after supper, she lectures her new roommate—an affectionate old woman, terrified of dying in surgery tomorrow—about the value of a good attitude.

She’s even satisfied with the food.  “It has definitely improved,” she crows.  “No doubt about it.  It’s that questionnaire I filled out.  You see?  Lots of people complained.”

Next day Mary, Mama’s roommate, lies doped on morphine, cheeks collapsed, her knee raised in traction.  Mama glowers in bed, miserable and angry. “Oy vey’s mir,” she mutters, “Oy vey’s mir.”  Her staples were removed, a terrible thing those ridges along the incision and such a stiffness deep inside.

“It’s not worth living life like this,” she cries.  “I’d like to go to sleep and never wake up.”

Her phone rings. “What?” she croaks.  “Call back later!”  And slams down the receiver on Herbert.  “He has no business calling before the rates change,” she snaps.

Rage chokes me.  I tie her shoes roughly.  Along the corridor and in the echoing bathroom she mutters, “I’ll be a cripple for life, I’m a mess.”

“You were better yesterday,” I say, gritting my teeth.

“Yesterday?” she says scornfully.  “That was yesterday.”

She plops with a grunt into a solarium hip chair.  Across the room, three girls are doting on the cook.  He boasts about the staph infection in his hip.  “The pain is horrible,” he says, “they have to open me up again—there’s lots of staph here.”

My heart pounds.  A new pain in her hip, such a stiffness deep inside. Luckily she can’t hear.

Infinite regress into the twilight of everlasting trouble.  By the time Dinah arrives, the ground is cracking, the future collapsing.  Staph infections.  Mama’s new pain.  They have to open people up.

“Maybe she really does have something wrong,” I say.

“Please ... don’t take her seriously,” Dinah says wearily.  “You know what she’s like.”

I run to the nurses’ station and look at her charts.  Normal temperature, normal blood work.

“It’s muscle and incision pain,” the head nurse says, “nothing else.”

Present and future subside into their tolerable marriage.

“What did I tell you,” Dinah says.

She taps Mama’s arm and leans into her better ear.  “Alexander’s has a sale on nightgowns—eight dollars reduced from fifteen.  You want one?”

Mama shrugs her off.  “Who needs anything new?  I’ll be a cripple for life, I’m a mess.”

Dinah leaves, discouraged.  Mama nibbles from a tin of vitamin pudding, emotion building in her face.  She sets the tin on the sill and strokes the ridges on her hip.  Out on the river an enormous barge crawls upstream.

Suddenly she shrieks, “I should jump out the window and get it over with!”

“Stop it,” I say.  “Have some pudding.”

Her cheek muscle twitches.

What can I draw from my bag of tricks?  What sharp shock?  I remember my stepfather sitting in the driveway on a folding chair, wearing plaid shorts and an undershirt.  Brutally, I ask how her sex life was with Leon.

Maybe she’s desperate, too.  “He was good till he was eighty,” she grumbles.  “But he shook the bed in the middle of the night.  I didn’t like it when he shook the bed and pretended I did it.”

She slides out of the hip chair and starts down the hall.  Every few steps she shudders dramatically, lips and jowls flaccid, eyes dull.

She squints at Mary, her sleeping roommate, hooked to an oxygen tank and a heart monitor, moaning.  I stroke Mary’s forehead.  She half wakes, grabs my hand, and, pointing frantically to the locker, begs me to put her leftovers in the fridge.  I set a can of soda beside her hat.

“Mary,” Mama confides, “it takes courage, Mary.  You have courage, Mary, I can see that.  As for me, Mary, I get despondent.”

Overheard on the bus.  “He’s at Oxford, getting a Ph.D. in despair.”

Surgeons rush from operation to operation like runners setting records.  Then they go out of town.  Morning after morning I try to reach Mama’s surgeon.

“You’re playing god,” I say when he finally answers the phone.  “You have to take responsibility for your language.  Get my mother to understand the difference between a stressed muscle and a mortal wound.  She’s afraid she’ll never walk without pain.”

He laughs and says he’ll take care of it.

“The nurses and I can talk till we’re blue in the face,” I insist, “she only listens to god.  She won’t even take pain pills because she thinks you don’t approve.”

He groans and says he’ll take care of it.

In the hospital, Mary’s diabetic daughter dozes in a chair.  Mary’s grandson, a burly cop, tenderly feeds her broth.

Mama is eating Salisbury steak, thoughtful, almost sprightly, on the verge of suppressed cheerfulness.

“Did you see the doctor today?” I ask.

She shrugs one shoulder, frowning.  “He came and he left,” she says.
“What did he tell you?”

Shrugs.  “He said it was a bigger operation because he took out the pins.”

“Anything else?”

A longer shrug.  “He said it takes time.”

“What else?”

“He watched me walk,” she says grudgingly, as if this were too much attention from a Top Man.

“And?”

The corners of her mouth turn down.  She barks, grief-stricken, “He said ... I walk ... great.”

A tug pulls a barge upriver past an island of apartment towers; a cable car glides across the bridge.  Mama splurged on a shampoo this morning.

“The Russian people will be better off,” she says to Dinah.

“Don’t talk nonsense,” Dinah snaps.  “It’s all propaganda.”

“In Sierpc,” I say, “when your father was gone all those years, who supported you?”

The sisters squabble closely.  Their mother’s parents and sister moved in, they agree, and everybody contributed a little something.  Their mother sewed underwear, their grandmother cooked, and Tante Ruchele made wigs.  The little scale on which Tante Ruchele weighed hair was also used for weighing bread.  Zeyde Alexander traveled from town to town, earning a bit as a balmegiekh, a proofreader of the Torah.  He was so pious, so dedicated to living for the hereafter, he ate no fish on the Sabbath for fear of breaking a bone.  They can’t decide if he was foolish or wonderful.

I’m sure he was wonderful.

My father’s flock of liturgical singers, my only influential ancestors till this moment, are old and long settled; some go back two thousand years.  Naturally they’re surprised by this invasion.  They shuffle, wail cantorially, grudgingly make room, and offer splintered chairs.  My maternal ancestors sit.  My great-aunt Ruchele hand-stitches a cap of hair, my great-grandmother makes fish soup, and my great-grandfather Alexander, the pious proofreader, scrutinizes words on a scroll.

Hair, fish bones, words.  A writer’s inheritance.  From Mama.

Mama’s upsie-downsie moods seem connected to her Percoset schedule.  I tell Barbara this over breakfast and she gets her pharmacology book.  Percoset, we read, is a morphine derivative that elevates the mood and induces depression.  So that’s it.  When Mama takes the painkiller her mood is raised to a nice balanced level.  On alternate days withdrawal and pain curdle her normally bleak disposition.

That dull look at the table, head on hand.  Not just hard of hearing.  Perhaps she’s been depressed since my father died and more so since she lost my stepfather.  Depression.  Not a label I ever applied to my mother.

I bring Mama a gift-wrapped cookbook of gourmet soups from Barbara.  “You were right,” I say, “not wanting to take Percoset.  It’s very strong and it has bad side-effects.  If you have pain the nurse says you can take Vicodin.”

“Who needs medicine?” she says. “It’s no good for you and it doesn’t even work.”

On to the next stage.  No postponement.  No exit.  Mama can walk with one cane and climb stairs.

On automatic pilot, I rent a hip chair and a commode.  Get Home Care Agency phone numbers.  Absorb Mama’s new aggravation, her emotional bridge from hospital to home, her rage that the Medicare rep ordered limited home care—three half-days for two weeks—when she’s entitled to full home care—daily for six weeks.  Definitely.  It’s her right.

 I distribute gifts to the nurses.  Learn how to put on compression stockings.  Say goodbye to shipboard friends of three weeks.  Have a final talk with the cardiologist.  Yuri and I pack up plastic pans, a grabber, toilet seat extension, and vitamin puddings.

The one-legged woman with the bourbon laugh waves gamely; the attorney in the plaid bathrobe waits for his edema to recede; the cook with the staph infection rolls in his chair.

Yuri and I take Mama home.

<i>Acceptance</i><br /><br />
The commode never arrives, but the stairs to the bathroom are no problem.  Mama is happy.

“It’s so good to be home,” she says.

No caretaker comes Monday; no caretaker ever comes.  Mama pays the crow’s price for greediness—striving for two crumbs she loses everything.  I encounter the Kafkaesque home care system, passed from one voice to another, negotiating with friendly women who never return my calls.  All week we sit on pins and needles—I’m sucked into Mama’s anxiety, waiting for the phone to ring.  And it’s all absurd.  I don’t want any help.  I like being alone with her.  We don’t need a strange woman rattling around the house.  Dinah comes every day.  She shops, we take meals together.  It’s intimate and rather simple—hard work, given Mama’s disposition, but cozy and full of promise.  That’s the most startling thing of all.

Her complaints lose their intensity, becoming a pro forma railing against fate.  She cuts back on, “Oy vey’s mir,” and admits she might, maybe, not be a cripple the rest of her life.

 “I’m afraid I’m getting better,” she says.

A friend of mine feels so daunted by responsibility for living things, he hesitates before accepting a plant.  I grow less daunted by responsibility for Mama, although she measures every action by its cost.  I get exhausted, but not angry.  I even get angry, but not debilitated.  We’ve broken the crust of decorum.  I see her toothless.  The bathroom door stays open.  I wash her legs and feet.  It’s surprisingly sweet, washing those puffy feet with angled toes and yellow nails that used to embarrass me at the beach.  I kiss her knees and rub lotion into her rough heels.

The first time I wash her feet, I spread a towel on the floor and set down a basin and a bar of creamy soap.  She’s enthroned on a hard swivel chair, on two pillows, wearing a blue sleeveless nightgown.

“You shouldn’t use that towel, it’s still clean,” she grumbles. “Not that washcloth, it’s a good washcloth.  Not that soap, I save it for my face.”

I sit on the floor, cross my legs, and wet the cloth.  “Mama,” I say, “when somebody does you a favor, be grateful.”

And that’s how it goes with us.  I’m pleased when I’m pleased and pissed when I’m pissed.  She still infuriates me—on her I use up a life’s worth of shouting.  And that’s real, too.

At bedtime I set crackers and milk in the bathroom, tuck her in, lay the grabber by her hand, and kiss both toothless cheeks.  She never responds.  Every night I kiss a stone goodnight.

“It’s not right,” she says, “you taking care of me.”

One night, after I kiss stone, she looks up thoughtfully.  “My mother never kissed me,” she says.  “And I never kissed my mother.”  She draws me to her, roaring with laughter, toothless mouth wide open.

I close her door, go down to the kitchen, and claim my life.  A little surge of freedom.  I eat two pieces of chocolate and phone Herbert, let his sustaining voice wash me in literature, classes, friends, himself.  I read myself to sleep, my bed a mattress on the livingroom floor.

 One night while I’m reading she calls hysterically.  I run to her.

“I’m having a heart attack.  Oy vey’s ts’mir.  It’s really terrible.”

“Which side?” I shout in her ear.

“The left.”

I misremember a movie scene, a man clutching his arm.  “I think heart attacks are on the right,” I shout.

“The left.”

“It’s on the right.”

“What do you mean the right!” she screams.  “Any dumb dope knows it’s on the left!”

I figure if she has the energy to scream, “any dumb dope,” she’s probably okay.  Experimentally I hitch her up on another pillow and she belches.

“That’s better,” she says.

Twice a day we walk outside for ten minutes.  She puts less weight on her cane.  Washes the breakfast dishes.  Since we don’t like the same food, I cook six meals a day, with lots of help from Dinah.  Generous Dinah, still marching passionately against social injustice.  Dinah, who never complains about her own troubles, who puts up with Mama’s reproaches and endless complaints.  Forever the younger sister.  We have an orgy of criticizing: it’s our safety valve.

“How would you feel if she died?” I ask.  I sit on the floor and Dinah sprawls in an easy chair.

She clears her throat.  Looks thoughtful.  “I’d miss the pain-in-the-neck,” she says.  “I’d miss her.”  She clears her throat again.

“So would I.”

“But why does she have to be such a pain in the neck?  Oh, I tell you ... you don’t know the half of it.  You don’t know what she’s like.”

“How come you’re so different?”

“Me?”  She clears her throat.  “They say Papa was very ashamed when Mama and Miriam were born—two girls, everybody pitied him.  So when I was born he said the hell with everybody, I’m going to brag about this one.”  She laughs.  “And when Jenny was born he gave up.”

I deposit a check in Mama’s account.

The bank manager asks, “Are you her friend?”

“No,” I reply, “I’m her mother.”  And laugh uncontrollably.


The uncertainty about home care eclipses other anxieties.  Mama always has “a big problem.”  The “big problem” now is who will take care of her in the mornings after I leave.

“Everybody comes home from the hospital with a woman.  Why not me?”

Monday approaches, the day I expect to leave, and we still don’t have an affordable woman to help her bathe, put on her compression stockings, and clean house.  Through a friend of a friend, Dinah finds a Russian woman eager for work and the problem is resolved, though, in Mama’s mind, not settled, since she resents paying for what should have been free.

“No point being aggravated over $150,” I say, “aggravation gives you a sour stomach.”  As Dinah says, you might as well talk to the wall.

“The money doesn’t count so much,” she repeats.  “I lost my rights.”

I protest one last time to the director of the Home Care Agency.  “The person I’m angry for isn’t my mother,” I say, “but the old woman who doesn’t have anyone—who goes home from the hospital and no one shows up Monday morning.  What about her?”

“It happens all the time,” the director says sadly, “to people who are very sick.”

I tell this to Mama.  “Don’t grouse about paying for help,” I say, “be glad you can afford it.”

“But everyone gets a woman from Medicare.”

“I’m telling you,” Dinah says, “you might as well talk to the wall.”

The friend who’d said I was capable of being intimate with my mother without losing myself turns out to be right.  I merge and feel whole, absorb her without getting contaminated.  At this time in our lives, when connection is vital, I’ve stopped resisting.  I think she expects resistance—even rejection—it validates her pessimism.  And simple attention seems satisfying, too.  Her eyes are wide open, her voice strong, her spirit youthful.  Her complaints are irritating, but not insane.  We can say what’s on our minds, good or bad.  Get annoyed.  Even be happy.  We kiss each other and mean it.  We are physically comfortable, without shame.  I know her from her feet to her gums.

Like a sunflower turning its heavy head to the sun, Mama is making an effort to be cheerful.  It’s her gift to me.  Her thanks.

My bladder cramp after Leon’s death traumatized her.  “I upset you,” she said, “I shouldn’t have said what I did.”

She brings it up now that I’m about to go home.  And, to be honest, I wonder what my body has in store this time.  I think we’re all right, Mama, my body, and me.  I’ve given her a haircut, bought a bathmat, cleaned the kitchen, filled the freezer with chicken soup, and pasted notes by the stairs, saying, “Up with the good leg, down with the bad.”  She knows how to pick up things with the grabber.  The emergency is over and healing will take its time.  Still, I lie awake my last night and go to the bathroom often.

In the morning she dresses nicely and we spend our last hour walking to the grocery.  For the first time in a month, she shops.  She picks out cantaloupes, carefully, two good ones, two for a dollar.

I get in the cab.  Mama and Dinah wave, two lively white-haired sisters, looking more and more alike.

“Don’t call me every day,” Mama says. “I know you ... you waste money on phone calls.”
