Monhegan is a tiny island eleven miles off the Maine coast.  Imagine a whale, its eye the village, its body spruce and deciduous forests, granite cliffs and coves.  About seventy people live there year-round, many lobstering in winter, sending children to the one-room school.  It has a library, museum, church, cemetery, post office, and a long history of painters.  For over thirty years we rented a hilltop house without electricity or phone, accustomed to kerosene lamps and water shortages.  We washed laundry by hand, took turns cooking, made music.  Michael, Yuri, and Herbert played Frisbee by the lighthouse at sunset.  As teenagers Michael, now a physicist, dug ditches; Yuri, a photographer, filled potholes with gravel.  Now Herbert and I write and he paints watercolors.  Yuri brings his family for a week every August.  Michael, married to a Greek underwater archeologist, spends summers on Crete.  He and his family love that large island the way I love this small one.

Low tide at Gull Cove.  Bright sun.  I crouch over a large tidal pool.  Sea grass ripples lazily, oxide-pigmented stones glow blood-red.  A quivering raft of magnetic filings floats on the surface, dense in the center and wiggly around the edges.  I break up the raft with a gull quill.  It reforms.  I stir the specks; they gather together.  Are they larvae?  Insects?  Do they swim or follow the current?  Ruthlessly, I stir the mass.  Small clumps quickly merge and grow; stragglers wriggle over alone or in pairs.  I stir them again and again, intrigued by their single-willed persistence, their race to the center, encouraging the slowpokes like a child watching raindrops race down a windowpane,.

I learn they’re anurids, tidal pool springtails—Anurida maritima—wingless insects related to jumping fleas.  Like lobsters, they propel themselves by flipping their tails from underneath.  Communal creatures, they secrete an aggregating pheromone.  They live two days to two weeks.

	 At Sunday breakfast I tell Herbert a dream.  We eat in the kitchen, at the oilcloth-covered oak table, windows facing the back yard.  Sun flickers on the old birch tree, leaves twitch in the breeze.  We linger over French toast and coffee.  At eleven-thirty I’ll open the museum, the former lighthouse keeper’s house.

	I say, “I dreamed we were driving a jet airliner down a beach runway in Sussex.  At the sea we made a slow, majestic right turn, taxied on hard sand, and stopped at a highway.  The plane became a car.  You drove alone, idling on the approach road; I ran in place behind.  You made a left onto the highway and just as I started to follow, an old black car from the thirties zoomed out of nowhere and cut in.  I ran on the road carefully and methodically as if I were a little car myself—like the man in Dodes Kaden who thinks he’s a trolley.  The sun beat down, heat rose off the cement.  You disappeared.  The old black car disappeared, its high roof swallowed in a cloud of dust and exhaust.  I ran on and on.  My legs felt very small and weak.”

I think it’s a death dream, I say, you disappearing.  That summer by the sea in Sussex after your subarachnoid hemorrhage—every time you traveled to the university, to that cement library, I was afraid you’d die.  It feels false.  The black car cuts into my thoughts as it cut into the dream and I follow it into a child’s world where cars, like planes, are gigantic and legs are very small.  I see a rumble seat on the car.  I run on a runway.  A taste of dust rises up.  I’m four years old.  All cars are black.  They whiz terrifyingly down Spring Street.  On trips I get carsick.  Since Daddy doesn’t drive, we depend on the charity of others.  The summer when I’m four Jimmy, from the Silk Mill, drives us to a bungalow colony in the Pocono Mountains.  I sit in back and he pulls over periodically so I can vomit.

I walk with Mama on a dirt road near the bungalow colony.  The sky clouds over, the wind picks up.  Mama says she hears a car, she’ll hitch a ride for us.  I beg her not to.  She invokes thunder and lightning.  I say I don’t mind getting wet.  A car stops.  What happened next?  Perhaps she said (in a frustrated, theatrical way because she thought she was doing the best for me), “If you don’t get in you’ll have to walk home all by yourself.”  Did I cry?  Cringe?  Plead?  I remember sitting up front beside the window.  I was never afraid of cars again.

After answering questions about island history at the museum, I walk down the hill to a phone and ask Mama how I lost my fear of cars.  “What do you mean afraid of cars,” she says, “you always liked going for a ride.”

This is not a terrifying memory quest.  Only curiosity about a small worm creeping through my psyche.

Immersion in the past is bracing, like plunging into an icy sea, grabbing Proteus, and holding tight through his slippery changes.  Insights turn false; patterns waver and collapse.  I think of people wrestling with brutal memories, trying to distinguish facts from vengeful fantasies.

	The summer in the bungalow colony, Mama and I probably took a walk every day.  Was I tired one time?  Did it rain another?  My suspicions create mirages.  She bends over and I shrink away—she threatens to leave me—a car door slams.  Did I chase a black car with a rumble seat on a dusty road?  How can I tell memories from grudges?  What I remember clearly is the approaching storm and our quarrel and sitting in a car against my will.  Fields lined both sides of the road.  Scruffy farmland, withered stalks, a dry, yellowish color.  The window was open.  I breathed hard.  The countryside whizzed by.

	What happened in the gaps?  The gaps have been flourishing on their own.  The gaps hold little dramas of terror, whole myths sculpted in miniature on cherry pits, mutating over the years into anxieties about rubber boots, mosquitoes, plane seats, heat, and the availability of typewriters in foreign countries.  I honor the gaps.  I respect their efficiency, their independence.  Their creative conversions.

Herbert loves traveling.  I dread it.  Athens.  London.  The names of foreign cities shoot from his mouth.  Other people thrive on travel books and itineraries but I, who love flying and visiting new places, dread transatlantic voyages.  Last time I couldn’t walk for two weeks, I say.  Or, I’ll feel like baggage.  I recite a litany of potential afflictions, string worry beads of roles and expectations.  I tell the truth and feel truth leach out, leaving only dry, deceitful words.

Dread, like pain, offends others.  I try to hide it, but accidents betray me, mainly affecting—I hesitate to say it—my feet.   Water and feet are joint tenants attached to dread, as if every trip through rain or across the sea takes me one step closer to death.  By now it’s a family joke.  At the start of four transatlantic crossings, I’ve either broken a toe or sprained an ankle, the laughable quirk exacting strange dues.

In 1990 we promised Michael, Elpida, and our granddaughter, Nike, to visit them in Greece.  I made travel arrangements.  Usually pessimism keeps me cheerful; prepared for the worst, my spirit soars.  But surrounded by people who believe in travel, their faith supported by epic poems, biographies, and fiction, I felt ashamed.  I wrestled with dark prophesies and blew on sparks of optimism.  I lied in the hope of gaining a cheerful attitude.  Greece itself, cultural heroine of the Western world, loomed like a daunting mother-in-law.

The day before leaving I stepped outside to mail a letter and sprained my ankle.  Helped by ice and an elastic bandage, I rolled through airports in wheelchairs and quickly recovered in Crete, where Elpida has been excavating the ancient harbor of Phalasarna.  The visit was deeply satisfying, a feast of family, archeology, visual beauty, and food.  Two days before returning home I stepped on a bit of ancient rubble and sprained the other ankle.

	What is this pathological dread that tugs like elastic or the anurids’ aggregating pheromone?  Why, when I want to go there, do I dread leaving here?
Water below the firmament and above the firmament.  Ritual immersion.  Birth and rebirth.  The toilet seats in elementary school yawned off their rims like alligators’ mouths, primed to flush the instant we sat down.  In first grade I peed only when desperate, certain I would fall in and be flushed away.  <br /><br />

<i>The rain came pouring down, </i><br />
<i>But my father was still downtown. </i><br />
			  <i>    .  .  . </i><br />
<i>No person would dare to venture </i><br />
<i>Into that dark and gruesome sea  </i><br />
<i>Whose waters spell death and destruction </i><br />
<i>To anyone who would near it be. </i><br /><br />

Long past fourth grade, my writings still begin with water—rain, the sea, washing dishes—rituals of cleansing perhaps, or a nod to elemental beginnings.

At the bungalow colony I fell on a broken bottle in the grass and my knee got infected.  Daddy, on vacation, took me to the doctor.  I sat on the examining table under a sloping roof,  legs dangling, feeling claustrophobic.  The doctor bent over my knee squeezing pus while Daddy, one hand in his windbreaker pocket, said teasingly, “You can’t guess what I’ve got,” and magically pulled out a transparent red lollipop shaped like a chicken.  Light fattened a scalloped wing; a tiny red eye glowed.  The barley sugar tasted smooth as custard.  I was proud of him and already embarrassed.

	My father wears a cape of shadows, his life in Poland billowing behind him.  His family died and his culture dwindled, yet he told almost no stories.   His life began with my consciousness of him; together we lived in the present.  Since he lacked a history, I lacked a history—I was born, I lived, we went on together.  But he did make that long secret journey.  How did he get from the mysterious Sierpc to here?  By the time I was old enough to ask, his family had died in the Warsaw ghetto.  His few childhood stories shine in my bag of memories.  He was kicked in the forehead by a horse.  He rode a big dog to the edge of town to pick peas.  His mother served him chicken breasts and thighs and his sisters wings and backs so traded under the table, giving the girls good parts for bad.

	“Daddy, how did you come to America?”  How did you get to the ship, is what I meant.

	He drew games from his pocket of evasions—counting my fingers and pretending one was missing, singing intervals and asking me to name them, kissing the top of my head—afraid, even ashamed, as if something had happened along the way that could still hurt him.

	Misinterpreting his silence, I imagined him sleeping in barns and begging for food, his shoes worn out.  As I grew older my imagination turned violent—he was beaten by peasants, bitten by dogs, and sexually molested by men.  I stopped asking questions.  Traveling is like unrequited love, his silence said—you hope for one thing and get another.  Don’t hope, don’t travel—at your destination something dreadful will be required.

	Once settled, he stayed put.

	Long after his death I asked Mama if Daddy ever told her how he came to America.  All I know is he traveled with a friend, she said.  Rummaging in a drawer, she unearthed a sepia photo and a memoir scrawled in English on lined yellow paper.  The photo, a studio portrait, is of two young men in new straw hats and shiny shoes, looking seriously into the future.  The memoir tells my father’s inner journey.

	His father and his grandfather, ritual slaughterers and much loved in their communities, live interchangeably in his memory.  “Who didn’t know or at least hear of Yankl Shoichet?” he writes of his father, using the same words for his grandfather.  “Not only as the expert shoichet, but as a person who was always ready to offer advice or favor to whoever needed it?  A person with a broad smile and always humming a tune.”  That’s basically all he reveals about my grandfather, Reb Yankl, and my great-grandfather, Reb Schloime, “pious but not fanatical” men wielding sharp knives to slaughter cows and perform circumcisions.

During the typhoid epidemic of 1916 my grandfather went from house to house visiting the sick, ignoring the “contagious” postings.  He caught typhoid.  When a hospital bed came vacant the family thanked God it was the bed of a young man who recovered—Leon Mintz—surely Leon’s lucky bed would protect him.  But he died.  He was only thirty-eight.

“A tree had fallen,” my father writes.

 He was twelve.  No joyous immersion in his bar mitzvah.  No proving himself to his beloved father.  Becoming a man in sorrow, he missed the full depth of the ceremony, his coming-of-age blunted, its emotional heart gravely altered.  That fallen tree saved his life.

His mother and the congregation expected him to become Reb Motl.<br /><br />
<i>But I had a thought of my own.  In the back of my mind I did not want to be a shoichet.  For a long time I couldn’t give my mother a good reason of the ‘why not’ that she nagged me with at every opportune time.  Unconsciously I hated that profession because as a child of a shoichet I had to be the example of the Jewish community boys.  If any other child broke a window or stole fruit in the vineyard it was excusable, but not Motl the shoichet’s son, O, no!  I had to behave regardless of age or place.  I used to ask my mother, why can’t I play like other children do, in thieves, soldiers, or any other children’s games.  She would say, ‘It does not look good for your father’s position.’  So I hated being the son of a father who has a position of public interest.  Unconsciously I didn’t want my children to feel the way I did.  I wanted my children to feel free to do whatever they felt, like other children. </i><br /><br />

Perhaps he also recoiled from the violent nature of the job—facing nervous, lowing cows, killing large animals.  Perhaps his father’s death alienated him from generations of men embracing each other through prayers and meals.

Relatives supported his mother and six children while she struggled and made sacrifices.  Cousins in New York took pity and offered him a job as a manager for their factory.  He was the eldest son, he could emigrate and bring his family to America.  Like many in his generation, he made the journey and worked hard, but the war and the Holocaust came too soon.  When he learned one sister survived he rejoiced in his grieving way and still kept silent.  Like a child who can’t bear to say goodbye to loved ones, he couldn’t bear to speak about his past: each telling, I think, would have been a goodbye and a thorn of guilt.  He wouldn’t even talk about his early years in the Mill.  “How could you tell Jimmy what to do,” I asked, “if you didn’t know English?”  He didn’t discuss transitions.  “I am the only one in our family,” he wrote, “who knows how it feels to be on its own.”  He told only one mythic story about early life in the Mill.  He was singing Schumann’s “Die Lotosblume,” accompanying himself on the piano, when a fly came through the open window and, as he took a deep breath, it buzzed into his mouth and he swallowed it.

My father swallowed punishment without complaining or resisting.  My mother didn’t give an inch.

What other childhood miseries may have knotted themselves into my dread of traveling?

	“I did terrible things,” Mama said on one of her annual visits to Champaign. We sat in the car, outside a copy shop on the University of Illinois campus.  “You shouldn’t know what I did when you were little—you’re like Daddy, always making the best of everything.”  She looked up sadly, coquettishly.  “I used to hit you when you didn’t fall asleep,” she said.

	How often I milked that story for comedy.  I remember lying on my stomach, acutely sensing Mama in the doorway.  My face inches across the pillow.  A moment’s comfort, then the back of my neck aches.  I tell myself to lie still, but my head needs to turn.  I hold my breath and inch again.  The pillowcase rustles.  She dashes over and pounds my back with arms stiff as broomsticks, shouting, “Shah! shah! shah!”

“Every night,” I said, “I  tried to turn my head without making noise.”

“You remember that,” she said, crying.  “It’s terrible.”

“I forgave you long ago,” I said.

	The next year, when my aunt Dinah came to Champaign with Mama, we reminisced at the kitchen table.  Prodded by Dinah, who filled in the gory details, Mama reluctantly admitted she force-fed me the first three years of my life.  Dinah squeezed her own cheeks to show how my mouth was forced open, how Mama shoveled in food, then held my mouth closed until I swallowed.

	“It’s horrible,” Mama said, “I did that, I held my finger right there.”

	A ghostly imprint in the soft flesh under my chin pressed upward delicately, firmly, like a birthmark.

	“You used to throw up,” Mama said sadly.

	Dinah, seizing a chance to tattle on her elder sister, launched into a revolting tale about a soft-boiled egg.  “‘One more spoonful,’ your mother said, ‘one more spoonful.’  And you pointed to your chin and said, ‘I’m full up to here,’ and you pointed to your mouth and said, ‘if it goes to here it’ll come out.’  So what did your mother do—she shoveled in more egg anyway—and out it came.”  Dinah pounded the table.  “Your meals looked like torture!”

	Mama leaned on her fist, alert and dejected.

	“You must have been angry at me,” I said, “I wouldn’t nurse, I wouldn’t eat.  You must have been angry.”

	“No,” she said.

	“She got sick,” Dinah said.

	Mama cocked her head to one side, thoughtfully.  “I hate to admit it,” she said, “but I didn’t enjoy you the way you’re supposed to enjoy a baby.  That’s why I didn’t want to have any more children.”

	“Maybe I was born perverse,” I said, “and refused to be mothered.”

	“No, no,” she said, “I pushed food into you.  When you nursed you took in too much air.  When you finished, I gave you more.”

	Dinah scoffed.  “She was afraid you’d die of malnutrition, and later she was sure you had rickets.  And then there was the sleeping—ask her about the sleeping—no one was allowed even to whisper.”

	Mama’s confession, with its trail of secret disappointments, liberated me.  She always said, and everyone agreed, that she loved and adored me—she had no other emotion.  Odd, I used to think, that we didn’t get along.  Odd, that offers of cottage cheese on the tip of a fork could make me scream.

	Early on, then, I orchestrated mothering from kinder hands.  Daddy came home to feed me lunch; when he was busy, he sent Jimmy.  “Bing me Maxie’s shoes,” I commanded from my highchair, and Mama hung my father’s felt slippers on my feet.  That’s how it was.  That was lunch.  How sad it must have been for Mama—sitting at the kitchen table, isolated and insecure.  Bad enough her baby eats better when Max does the feeding—but Jimmy, his burly right-hand-man—that’s the final insult.

	No wonder an undercurrent of anger ground beneath her love.  She used to call me a tsatske—how lovingly she said it—my tsatske.   I thought it meant little treasure, but it implies not well adjusted.  Proud of my independence, she was also intimidated.  She pushed food, clothes, and opinions so fervently at people, she didn’t notice that she pushed them away.  “I have an inferiority complex,” she said.  “Dinah is much more popular.”  And yet the honesty of her pushing left me free.  She was the blustering North Wind, primitive and direct, sharpening the traveler’s powers of resistance; whereas the much-praised South Wind is insidious—forcing the traveler to conspire, coercing the traveler to engage in the process of self-defeat.

	I thanked her for the confession—an unexpected gift, coming from a woman her age.

From the back windows of our Spring Street apartment, high on a weedy hill, I watched freights crawl beside the river, smoke plumes from their engines waving like flags.  We always lived within hearing distance of trains—the skid and clank of shunting freight cars and the whistle of passing engines.  LVRR was an incantation—Lehigh Valley Railroad—its colors red and black.  Passenger trains had magic power, too, the Black Diamond barreling down the track in a hail of cinders, rolling us to New York, to Mama’s family in their vertical <i>shtetl.</i><br /><br />
My grandfather abandoned his family for sixteen years before bringing them to America.  He repaired shoes in London, went to Russia for the revolution, and ended up a pants cutter in New York.  Mama, the eldest, was six when he left Sierpc, and became her mother’s helper.  She’s the serious one in the photographs, dreaming of being a teacher or an actress.  When marriage took her to Bethlehem, the Christmas city, she ran toward her lost childhood and dragged me along.  “I was never acclimated,” she said.

	Two children walked down a hot and dusty road, a Mommy-girl and a four-year-old.  “If you won’t get in the car,” said the Mommy-girl, “I’ll go without you.”  The four-year-old heard, “Nyah-nyah, scaredy cat.”

The drama repeated itself—Mama running ahead and me lagging behind.  Two years later we took another walk in the country.  Sunny day, fields and woods all around, fat cows and bright daisies.  Ahead, railroad tracks cut across the road.  As we approached, a freight train hooted and the crossing gate dropped.  Mama heroically slipped around the gate and boldly outran the train while I folded my arms on the shuddering wood, hiding my eyes.

Sitting at the kitchen table on Monhegan, stirring up memories, that mythic scene returns, glowing with pastoral despair.  And glowing with absurdity.  A gate at a country railroad crossing?  The landscape explodes.  Sunlit pastures wink out and cows sail away while the gate and I drift down, shedding daisies and small trees, and land in the shadow of blast furnaces, in the hard crabbed past.

Mama and I walk through a neighborhood of Steel Mill warehouses and machine shops.  Railroad tracks lie ahead, a broad corrugated swath between us and the Hill-to-Hill bridge.  As we approach, bells ring, red lights blink, and the crossing gate drops.  To our left a train crawls, its tail winding.

	“Let’s cross,” Mama says.  “There’s plenty time.”

	“We’re not supposed to,” I say, tugging her hand.  “We’re supposed to stop-look-and-listen.”

The train grows larger.

	“Don’t be an <i>akshen</i> [stubborn],” she says, pulling her hand away—that soft, pudgy hand.  She slips around the gate, high heels crunching gravel, purse dangling from the crook of her elbow.

	The engine hoots.  I can’t look.  I fold my arms on the gate and fold myself into its vibrations.  As the locomotive bears down, I imagine Mama’s arms upraised, her body flying, crushed.  The locomotive roars by, then the freight cars.  The gate stops vibrating.  Terrified, I look up.  Mama stands on the other side, her white blouse gleaming in the sun.  She shakes her finger and calls defiantly through the noise, “See, I told you.”  The Mommy-girl is satisfied; she won.  Miserable, I trudge across the raised tracks and graveled ties, bonding to worn steel, splintered wood, and crushed stone.

	My dread of leaving is born here, in these stories.  Mama’s going on ahead is a mulish sort of travel with an ambiguous backward kick, the effects incubating for years.

	Is this the worst?  We spent my first six years together, all day long, six formative years.  What did we do?  Why don’t I remember?  I see her pudgy hands, hands that she softened with lemon juice, but not her face.  I see the hands chopping onions, sewing, serving lamb chops and peas.  In my baby photos she holds me stiffly and I pull away.

	My father, on the other hand, sits in my nursery, lit by bars of sunlight.  I see his mournful eyes and big nose, I hear him singing around the house.  He scoops shampoo ice cream out of my hair and cleans my scraped knees with peroxide.  We plant carrots in the victory garden and ride the trolley to Mr. Kelchner’s piano studio where little turtles crawl in a dish.  Is this idealized, too?

As a child I used to lie in bed and let my eyes unfocus, creating fragmented doubles of the furniture.  Single, double, single, double—a game.  I still do it.  Everything has a secondary aspect—crooked, or missing a bite.  Conflict is a form of double vision.  Conflict is an old friend.  Conflict is sustenance, as a deformity is sustenance when you’ve grown around it.  Perversely, traveling appears in my writing as a metaphor for liveliness and independence.  A woman descends a ladder into an underground world.  A woman from a small town hops a freight train to New York.  A woman rides a bicycle on a railroad track, the tail of her kerchief lifting in the wind.

	Alas, my stories brought out Mama’s own conflicts.  “So why do you write about a woman going through a hole in the floor?” she lamented in 1993 after Little, Brown published my first novel.  “If only I was a better mother you wouldn’t have to be an artist; you could have been normal.”

	What a lament, what a plea for ordinary life.  Art is sublime, but artists suffer.  Better to sit in the sun, drink hot water with milk, grow old comfortably.  These ideas sounded heretical coming from a woman, eighty-six and partly deaf, still striving to improve her singing, still performing in public.

	And since she was eighty-six I stopped blaming her.  The youthful spirit that blighted my early years and infuriated me as I grew older, became an engaging source of charm and energy.  Free to discuss our conflicts, I was also free to appreciate her.  We were more honest with each other.  I told her I inherited her love of nature and her artistry.  I thanked her for always respecting me, for introducing me to idealistic women, for being a good confidante.  I tried to understand how her skepticism coexisted with naiveté, how she could be an atheist yet believe God made the world in seven days.  She, on her side, tried to understand how I could possibly prefer writing to singing, since music is the only art and singing its highest expression.  She still pushed; I still said, “Mama!”  But she replied, “Why do you always say, ‘Mama!’”  And I didn’t get angry.

	My father, long dead, holds me lightly at the end of a silken ribbon.  It dances in the wind, so fine, so dark—a binding on a cardboard spool, woven from gossamer threads that spin off cones atop the bobbin machine and fall in ivory tangles on the floor.  From him I have a secret dread of traveling: he taught me the deep, dark turns, the twists and spins, the knots.

	My mother’s iron claws were not entirely her own.  A second-class, despised Eve, giving birth to Eve, she infected me with an ancient, inherited self-hatred.  Her mother, a pious woman, was cursed with daughters, and she, the eldest, brought home a female grandchild, giving her parents no gladness.  “Oy, gevalt!”  she cried out in her sleep.  “Oy, vey’s mir,”  she muttered around the house.  She walked the edge of a precipice, one step from nothingness, forever in danger.  I am separate, balanced, distinctly different.  But nothing completely saved me from her visceral hold—not intelligence, nor love, nor detachment; not feminism, not philosophy, not art.  When I was with her my innards malfunctioned, going their separate, destructive ways—a common problem, I find, among independent daughters of many ages and walks of life.

	Traveling is a mental affair, through deserts and jungles, out of primeval waters into the final dark.  I bypass the original journey that we all take and the final one that waits and think of the small journeys in between.  I make too much of them, I exaggerate, or they exaggerate themselves within me.  Perhaps the stories that have risen to the surface will open doors to other stories, and I will travel further backward, loosening my dread of leaving, as my ancestors loosened bindings in the clothes of the dead to keep their spirits free.
