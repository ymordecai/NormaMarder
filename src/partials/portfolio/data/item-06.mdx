Baker Street in Sierpc was called Jewish Street.  Rabbis, cantors, and the shoichet; wine, vinegar, and candle makers.  Across from Mama’s house stood the main synagogue, a beautiful wood building with Byzantine domes and stained glass, a synagogue for the rich to use and the poor to admire.  Mama, her sisters, and friends adored the synagogue—little girls in apron-covered dresses and boots.  Ghosts hide there at night, the friends said—we must put our aprons over our heads.  Why? Mama asked, why should we put aprons over our heads?  So the ghosts will go away, they said.  Mama thought, if they believe in ghosts and magic aprons, God is nonsense and fools believe.

She tells that story often, tells it proudly and sweetly, an enchanting childhood epiphany.

Her father abandoned her and God disappeared.  She and her sisters weren’t rebellious.  They didn’t reject religion; they turned toward absence.  Became atheists.  Nonbelievers.  Clung passionately to the negative of God, to belief in the negative.  If I can’t touch it, Mama always said firmly, it’s not there.  (Although the stars, she admitted, were there, and quite far, too, at least a mile up.)  The sisters whose something was nothing eventually filled the space with communism.  A new doctrine, a new god, a new Eden.

Papa left us to better his condition, Mama said.  No, Dinah said; after the army he felt cramped and besides he hated our grandmother—who could blame him?  Mama was six when he left, Miriam four, Dinah three, and Jean one.  For sixteen years their Papa existed through letters and their grandmother’s curses.  Reading his news from afar—working on the Sabbath in London, traveling to Russia for the revolution—the girls swallowed an exciting dogma: religion is superstition; communism is salvation.  Their minds danced with absence, conspired with it, creatively filled a vacuum and bonded with the creation.  How could they resist?  Their absent Papa, lodging in their hearts and minds, was terrifying and seductive, like Jehovah.

That’s my theory, anyway.  Dinah says, nonsense—we became communists because of our mother—she was religious, but she cared about social justice, about poverty—after we came to America Papa’s politics made a big impression because our mother already influenced us.

He brought them to New York in 1929 after establishing himself as a cutter of men’s trousers—brought them to a top-floor walk-up with enough beds and a toilet.  He was a stranger, very nervous, and they quickly married, except Miriam.  He intimidated their husbands.  Mama moved to Bethlehem.

It’s 1945; I’m eleven.  My grandparents and Miriam have that top-floor apartment to themselves and Dinah and Jean and their families have apartments on the ground floor.  My grandfather dominates, rules from on high, you might say, with silence and thunder.  He has a square mustache, tight lips, and fierce blue eyes.  A basso profundo, he sings around the house in the broad style of great Russian basses.  Does he hate music or is he a clod?  He chops up songs, a verse from this and a verse from that, holding the low notes.  A few bars of a Red Army song, a low note, a few bars of a Yiddish song, a low note, a few bars of “Ol’ Man River.”  Tortured by his fractured medleys, I imagine our butcher, Herman with the stained apron, chopping up cows.

I look at old sepia photos and compare Zeyde Schloime in his twenties with Daddy’s father, Zeyde Yankl, at the same age.  Zeyde Schloime, with a handlebar mustache, lolls in a chair, flanked by friends.  Zeyde Yankl, with a long beard and frock coat, stands straight and severe.  Both grandfathers abandoned the children who became my parents.  Zeyde Schloime traveled; Zeyde Yankl died.  Not unusual in a time of war, persecution, and poverty.  Children grew up dreaming of the Goldeneh Medineh, the golden land of America where people were so rich, coins lay in the street for the blind to pick up.  Most of the dreamers from Sierpc died in concentration camps or the Warsaw Ghetto.

At home I sit naked on my parents’ bed after a bath, pulling on underpants.  Mama watches.  Mama always watches.  I’m eleven already but she still watches.

“What’s that?” she asks, pointing at my vagina.

I bend over.  Little white curds, like cottage cheese, dot the lips.   “Nothing.  Soap.  Forget it.”

“An infection!” Mama wails, clapping her cheeks.  “You won’t have children!  It could happen!  Gollycheevillakus!”

Mama’s a living epic of displacement and substitution.  When she’s frustrated she says, “golly,” and when she’s upset, she screeches “gollyjeewillakers,” (pronounced in Pennsylvania Dutch).  She’d be mortified to know golly means God and jee willakers—jee whiz—means Jesus.

I pull on my pants and socks while Mama paces back and forth, twisting her wedding ring.  She’s a little woman, shorter than me, with brown hair and beautiful hazel eyes.  Beams flare out of her eyes and wrap around me, thin tentacles probing and measuring.

“It’s a discharge,” she says emphatically, implying not only putrefaction, but rejection and dishonor.

When I was four the beams wrapped around my legs and I stumbled in her presence.  Daily she wept over the discolorations on my shins—all the lovely blues, purples, and greens.  Leukemia—of course it was leukemia.  She took me to a specialist, a “top doctor,” who held my legs in his lap and, gently pressing the flowering bruises, said I didn’t have leukemia, I was simply a clumsy child.  Was she disappointed?

Poor Mama.  Holding me, she regressed to her own childhood when bombs fell in the streets and she led her sisters to the shelter, a child charged with their safety, learning fear.

I hear her on the phone, discussing the discharge with friends, my private fluid shuttling through the wires—a crisis, a project.

“I made you an appointment,” she says proudly.  “It’s a new clinic, a husband and wife from New York.  She’s a top doctor.”

“I feel fine,” I say.

Her eyes blaze.  “An infection is very dangerous, believe you me.”

“It’s not an infection,” I insist.  “Nothing hurts.”

“Why must you always say the opposite?” she hisses, her jaw jutting forward.

We take the bus to the South Side, near the Steel.  The clinic is a squat yellow brick building across from a movie theater.  A sign in the window says “Internal Medicine.”  Bruce F. Wald, MD, Ingrid J. Wald, MD.  We sit in an empty waiting room.  Bare white walls, hard chairs.  Four closed doors, two on each side.  A door opens and a big woman appears.  Starched white coat unbuttoned over a dark gathered skirt.  A crown of braids.  No lipstick, no smile, no small talk.  The plain look of the progressive women my mother admires.  She carries a clipboard and a fountain pen.  Mama eagerly answers questions about my condition, telling more than is asked.

The doctor takes me into a white room, alone.  A fluorescent light hums.  She writes at her desk while I reluctantly take off my skirt, slip, and underpants.  I lie on a high table, knees up under a starched sheet.  She puts on gloves.  I close my eyes.  Rubber fingers poke inside me.  Why is this strange woman prying in my body, hurting what never hurt before?  What is that cold metal, that feeling of stretching?  “Just relax,” the doctor mutters.  “This isn’t going to hurt.”  She stabs me.  Shock opens my eyes.  The doctor is straightening, holding a steel syringe in rubber fingers.  Is that a smile, that thin upturn in her face?

“Two more treatments should clear it up,” she says.

Walking hurts.  I bleed on the bus; I bleed for two days, horrified by the brown stains on my pants.  I scrub the stains on a washboard in the bathroom sink, scrub the white cotton furiously, secretly, and refuse to go back.  The doctor’s sacrificial benediction, “This isn’t going to hurt,” has inoculated me against reassurances.  Wild horses can’t drag me.  Concentration camp stories have reached us.  Starvation.  Gassing.  Medical experiments on women, children injected with diseases.  I dream about white-coated Nazi doctors in braids and dirndl skirts, triumphantly brandishing steel syringes.

Fortunately a scandal closes the clinic.  A man has a heart attack in the street and the male Dr. Wald refuses to tend him, saying, “We don’t like to sign death certificates.”  Mama is shocked by hidden wickedness in progressive people.  I’m not so innocent.  Life is life.  Everything falls in the puddle.

The discharge vanishes.

The summer before my junior year at Brandeis, I have an affair with a sociologist from another university—handsome, divorced, in his thirties.  We take long erotically charged walks by the sea while the chicken soup on his stove boils to a film lining the pot—essence of chicken soup, he calls it.  His eyes are mournful, dark, and hooded like my father’s.  We go to concerts and movies.  Talk soulfully.  I’m still a virgin, on the rebound from an unreliable boyfriend.  The sociologist is sexy and patient; he knows how to seduce a young woman.  We sleep in his bed two nights, taking our time, taking my time.  Anticipation is delicious.

The third night I say yes passionately—yes to him, yes to womanhood, yes to the thrilling fear of initiation.  There’s a disappointing pause while he stops to smear jelly on his penis.  He climbs on top of me.  A slippery thing slides in and out for a few seconds while he breathes loudly.  He grunts and collapses.

So this is it, I think.

He rolls off.  We lie on our backs, naked, looking at the ceiling.  “You weren’t a virgin,” he says.

“Is that a joke?”

“I happen to know what a virgin feels like,” he says.  “And they bleed.”
How quickly intimacy turns to war.  Nothing to defend.  Can’t defend.  Not believed?  Me?  The truth-teller?  Truth keeps the world from spinning off its axis.  Which is why I didn’t sleep with my unreliable first love.

“I wouldn’t have cared,” he insists.

He barely penetrated, I think, that’s what happened.  A slippery little penis.  Of course I didn’t bleed.

“This was my first time,” I manage to say.

“There’s no reason for you to lie.”

 “Take me home,” I say, and that’s that.  For a few months he behaves with irresistible chivalry, phoning to organize blind dates with his friends—a medical student and two psychologists.  (One becomes famous as Patty Hearst’s and Anne Sexton’s analyst.)  He shows up in the Brandeis cafeteria one day and brings his tray to my table, looking confused and bereaved.

 “I’m just looking for the truth,” he says, wearily.  “I like you a lot.  You seemed … you still seem … so fundamentally honest.”

False accusations are mental torture—guilt attaches so easily.  “I was a virgin,” I say doggedly, “you’re the first man I ever, uh, slept with.”  I feel as if I’m lying.

“Believe me,” he says, “I’m not hung up on having a virgin.”

“If that’s your heart’s desire, you had it.”

He rests his chin in his hands, his hooded eyes cold.

We could battle to the death like religious zealots.  He picks up his tray.  I finish my lunch.

Years later I think about the dubious phrase, losing one’s virginity.  The rupture of a membrane.  The sharing of desire through penetration.  I go to Webster’s for a definition of virgin.  “5. Any female animal that has not yet copulated.  8. As yet without contact.”

If he’d asked questions, our truths might have connected.

Pain.  Blood.  A woman in a starched white coat and dirndl skirt.  A sharp
 sexual attack, a rape with a syringe.  I see the flash of cultured cruelty, the syringe held aloft.  Surgical steel in a cold room, gleaming knives in steel trays, white walls and porcelain.  The hygiene of sadism.  The sadism of hygiene.  My mother rises anxiously from a chair in the waiting room, offering a worried hopeful look.

“I really appreciate your taking the time, Doctor,” she says.


Insecure mothers fuse with their daughters, redressing their own blighted childhoods.  A hungry little girl, a sick little girl—weakness makes shaky mothers feel strong.  Push, push.  Potatoes.  Hamburgers.  Cough syrup.  Do something for the child.  Here, have some more.  Let me feed you.  Take your medicine.  Eat your lamb chop.  Go to sleep.  It’s common as dust.  Mama doesn’t believe in medicine, but she does need authority.  Doctors are her accomplices, inspiring her to inflict pain in the name of love.  How do you feed a baby?  Stuff the breast in her mouth after she’s finished nursing.  When she spits out cereal?  Squeeze her cheeks, shove in another spoonful, and hold her jaw shut till she swallows.  Sprained ankles?  Steel arches in her shoes.  Alas, Mama’s frugality puts me at the mercy of inept practitioners.  The optometrist fits me with bifocals so I can’t see the piano keys.  The dentist’s drill gets stuck in my molar.  A surgeon cuts an x through a cyst on my back, leaving a hideous scar and fertile subcutaneous material.

She means well.

Eventually I grow breasts.  These are the relatively calm years between the peril of childhood diseases and the peril of boyfriends with cars.

“Look at that,” Mama says, studying my naked body.  “One breast is larger than the other—why should one breast be larger than the other?”  Not why is one smaller, but why is one larger.  (Engorgement, multiplicity, cells running wild.)  “Gollycheevillakus,” she wails, clapping her cheeks.  “Why can’t you be normal?”

For this catastrophe a retired doctor who charges only five dollars a visit is okay since I’m not actually ill, only deformed.  The doctor’s house is on a slope, his front yard terraced, his office dark with wood and leather.  After a brief embarrassing examination he sets a dictionary of abnormalities on a reading stand and leafs through it.  “Look here,” he says and draws me close to a page.  Framed by small type is a photo of a sad naked young girl standing stiffly, palms pressed to the wall.  One breast is small and the other balloons down to her waist.  “I suppose that could happen to you,” the doctor says.  The gargantuan breast, bulbous at the bottom as if weighted with fluid, prints itself on my future.  I suffer morbid self-consciousness as it lengthens over time, drooping to the girl’s belly, to her thigh, to her knee.

Who is this woman, my mother?  This insecure bundle of generosity and frugality, crippled by poverty and early responsibility?  This woman who adores me and unconsciously resents the trouble I cause?  Who actually boasts of an inferiority complex?  I create my past by stringing stories like collector’s beads.  I would create hers, but understandably she’s buried most of it.

“I was in school,” she says.  “I went to the bathroom—not a bathroom, an outhouse—and what did I see?  Blood.  I’m dying—I was sure I was dying.  Of course I didn’t tell anybody—who could I tell?  I said to myself, I’m so young, only fourteen.  All the way home I said to myself, I’m so young, only fourteen.  I came in the house crying, ‘Mama I’m dying.’  She said don’t be a fool and got a couple rags.”

My father also has a bleeding story.  “What’s that dent in your forehead?” I ask.

“I played the violin,” he says, “not very well, but I played, and everything was very costly.  Strings, what could you do, you had to buy—but hairs for the bow you got direct from the horse.  Naturally you had to be careful and pull only one hair at a time.  This horse was very sensitive.  Oy, did my mother cry when she saw blood streaming down my face.  But I got the hairs.”

Persistence.  Life is water, but they are persistent.  Canning, scrubbing, singing, planting, mowing, chopping, writing, sewing, ironing, repairing.  Movement without end, each completion the pause before a new beginning.  Secularized, restless, warding off decay and poverty.

Mama believes Mother’s Day is a capitalist plot.  She belongs to the local communist group—euphemistically called progressive—which devotes itself to improving wages and conditions for the steel workers.  Group, not cell.  Mainly she bakes cookies for meetings.  The people are open and lively, treat me like an adult, and fill their homes with plants.  “Whose side are you on?” they sing.  Union organizers come regularly for supper—for awhile it’s Bill and Jean and their baby.  They’re blond and beautiful; I’m not allowed to know their last name or say hello outside the house.  They outline strike plans at the dining room table, Jean boldly nursing while Mama serves spaghetti and meatballs.  Such freedom, such abandon.  My aunts disappear to nurse their babies; this young woman calmly exposes one fat nipple at a time while twirling spaghetti and discussing strike tactics.  I think her breasts are the same size.

I skim <i>The Daily Worker</i> past screaming headlines and sinuous persuasions to the comic strip which features the adventures of auto factory workers struggling for equality—downtrodden men but strong.  One day the strip betrays the narrowness of that equality.  The hero and his comrade are assembling an engine and criticizing the boss.  A woman in a belted uniform walks by.  The hero says, “Some chassis, huh?”  Chassis.  Woman as car body.  Metallic.  Functional.  Exempt from ideals of equality.  Disgust coats my tongue.  I bury <i>The Worker</i> underneath <i>The Bethlehem Globe-Times</i> and never read it again.  From now on I’m a double agent, keeping my parents’ politics secret from the world and my loathing of <i>The Daily Worker</i> secret from my parents.  I enjoy the doubleness, the power of secret thoughts.

Keeping their secrets is a virtue and an act of imagination.  I make up stories and live under different skies.  I romanticize outcasts, and loyalists who  withstand torture.  Chameleon-like, I take on the coloration of other people.  Every situation has a way out; all I need is a thread of resonance and I can connect with almost anyone.  Keeping secrets teaches me to live with illusions and feel powerful.  It’s a common magic trick among children who protect their parents, whether ashamed of them or proud, whether hiding alcoholism or political beliefs.

My secrets feel dangerous when the Rosenbergs are charged with treason.  Anti-communist fervor explodes in Liberty High School.  Let’s fry the commies, teachers and classmates say.  Like my family, I believe the Rosenbergs didn’t steal atomic secrets for the Soviet Union, but I can’t speak up.  Red Diaper babies in New York organize petitions and march with youth groups.  I maintain discipline and keep silent.  I feel split, frozen.  My center slides away and only my tongue speaks.

First week of college I walk into my dorm’s Common Room and find the furniture rearranged.  Students and faculty are watching a black-and-white TV tuned to the HUAC hearings.  They roar passionately, recklessly booing McCarthy and cheering a witness who won’t name names.  Their families aren’t in danger, I think.  Stone-faced when cheers erupt, I tap my fingers on my palm, still vigilant.

On a cruel Sabbath the Rosenbergs are executed and the witch hunt continues.  FBI agents visit Mama.

In the fall of 1954 my boyfriend and I are sitting on the floor of my room.  I open the mail.  Daddy has sent a letter and a folded newspaper clipping.  He writes once a week, usually about health and safety, and encloses clippings about engagements, weddings, and deaths.  The letter says Mama’s group was betrayed by Herman, the butcher.  I unfold the clipping.  The air grows thin.  “Senate Group Lists Names of Over 200.”  There’s Mama, on the second page, following her friend Maude.  “Gert Rajcak,” (first name abbreviated and last name misspelled), “Bethlehem housewife, who left the party in 1950.”  On the list are some old friends and acquaintances.  The sharp old guru, Mother Bloor.  Bill and Jean—finally I learn their last name.  Everyone is identified by profession.  Electricians, housewives, a dental assistant, artists, writers, delicatessen clerks, steel workers, furriers, professors, farmers, and a minister.  <i>Luckily,</i> Daddy writes, <i>Mama’s name was misspelled and no one recognized it.  </i><br /><br />
Herman, the butcher, a stool pigeon.  Informing for ten years.  Who could have guessed?  Herman’s, where we bought our meat.  Herman, with the smile and the stained apron.

I tap my boyfriend’s knee.  He’s a grad student in psychology; he likes confessions.  A geyser of laughter springs up and catches in my throat.  “My mother is a communist,” I say for the first time in my life.  And swallow the sweet pain of relief.
