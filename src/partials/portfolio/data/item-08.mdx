<p>A wise oak stood in the forested cemetery across from our
summer house, its arthritic limbs spreading above a burl-circled eye, its
ancient bark covered with mosses and fungi.  Everyone loved that tree.  When we
returned this summer, it looked crippled, having lost a massive limb in the
winter.  Another limb fell during a July storm, smashing headstones.  Arborists
invaded the cemetery with chainsaws and a chipper.  “Stop,” I screamed. “You’re
murdering my tree!”  It took them a week.  Day after day I photographed the
fallen parts--the huge recumbent trunk, the wooden flesh, gnarly burls, the
inner eye.  Its death felt personal, ominous.  I heard a pagan clang, a
foretelling.  The stump weathered from burnt sienna to gray.  </p>

<p>In November a
heart attack felled my aunt Regina, two weeks after her hundredth birthday.  I
thought she was immortal.</p>

<p>Her hall closet looks
different.  Fewer jackets, fewer shoes, a quart of bleach.  “What’s bleach
doing there?” I ask.  Regina laughs.  “You know me--it’s easy to get for the
kitchen and the bathroom.”  “Two bottles would be even easier,” I say.  She
clears her throat.  “Your mother says what do I need two bottles for.” </p>

<p>My mother and aunts function as sea
creatures, defending themselves from predators.  Mama, the eldest, squirts ink;
my neurotic aunt, the beautiful one, makes whirlpools; the youngest, the fat
one, hides under a rock.  Regina, the peacemaker, floats with the tide. </p>

<p>Family, friends--her voice lights
up when she says our names.  She’s always ready for a visit--cake in the
freezer, candy dish full.  Lately she’s been giving things away--“Here, take
it, take it,” she laughs, “I don’t need it.”  Saturday afternoons friends come
over to play May I, a children’s card game, turning on the opera so no one
should look down on them for gambling.  Sometimes Regina loses as much as ten
cents.</p>

<p>In good weather they stand on
Nostrand Avenue, passing out flyers about racism, war, and health care.</p>

<p>It’s hard coaxing memories out of
Mama and Regina.  Their faces twitch--who wants to remember Poland?--those
miserable years--their father gone, bombs falling, eight people in a one-room
apartment, the four sisters squeezed in a double bed, head to foot like
sardines.  Mama remembers the outhouse in winter.  Regina remembers playing
tricks.  She throws a dead fly down her little sister’s blouse.  She slips
under the table and tickles her sisters’ feet.  One night, as their grandmother
spoons out supper, she screams, “A <i>schmatte</i> got cooked in the soup!
There’s a dirty <i>schmatte </i>in the soup!”  She pins a big rag on the
beautiful one’s back during a dance.  Their mother calls her mean, but she
doesn’t feel mean. She loves her sisters. She just needs to laugh.  </p>

<p>She worries now she took advantage,
playing tricks like that.  “Why did such ideas come?” she asks me.  “Did I hurt
my sisters?” </p>

<p>Their father, enlightened by the
Russian revolution, settles in New York and sends for them.  The papa they
loved in dreams.  A cold stranger.  Very nervous.  Glaring at their mother with
fierce blue eyes.  The apartment in Brooklyn is impressive, though--an indoor
toilet and only two to a bed.  They buy flapper dresses and cut their hair. 
They learn English, get jobs in a dress factory.  Regina tells me he pinched
her bottom--“Maybe because I was cute,” she says.  Did my grandfather pinch all
of them?  He pushes them to marry quickly.  The beautiful one has many
proposals, but no one is good enough.  The others marry men they can rule;
ruling a husband feels like equality.  </p>

<p>Regina marries
Izzy, a laundry man, because he makes her laugh.  How long does it take for the
delightful to become irritating, for the part to become the whole?  He makes a
joke out of everything.  Takes no interest in people.  He laughs like a
donkey.  She can’t take him seriously; she starts needling him, making fun of
him--even in public.  And once she gets started--feeling mean, then getting
used to it--ridicule becomes automatic, a self-loathing abuse that makes him
retreat even more until they’re caricatures, their marriage a long-running
cartoon.  “Talk normal,” she shouts. “Why do you have to talk crazy?”  He
laughs.  What can she do?  She looks for the best.  He understands the class
struggle.  He’s a hard worker.  He drives a truck.  He eats what she cooks.  If
a difficult decision has to be made, he makes it.  As my neurotic aunt says,
you have to give credit where credit is due.</p>

<p>I’m four when Regina has a
baby--sweet, easy-going Howie--phlegmatic, my aunts call him adoringly,
pinching his fat cheeks.  Sweet boys are good--they don’t like aggressive
boys.  Nine years later Regina has Ben.  A little devil, my aunts say, a real
handful.  “Too big for his britches,” Izzy says.  </p>

<p>Izzy and his brothers open a store
in Sheepshead Bay, selling dinette furniture, and the family moves to a
brand-new building. </p>

<p>The great, secret loves of Regina’s life are two movie stars--Paul Muni and Charlie Chaplin.  She, herself, is the great, secret love of their friend, Sol.  Quiet, opera-loving Sol, married to drama-queen
Tania--Tania’n’Sol, fixtures in a group of left-wing friends, each couple one
word, united for better or worse, often worse, till death.  I find them
innocent and sexless, even the couples with children.  They sing in the Jewish
People’s Philharmonic Chorus--The Chorus, it’s called, as if there were no other.</p>

<p>I’m in the conductor’s shabby hotel
suite with three other singers hired for The Chorus’s annual concert.  “Just a
minute,” he calls.  His bedroom door opens, and out steps Tania, lipstick
fresh, tying a flowered kerchief on her head.  I freeze in my chair; she
freezes in the doorway.  The silver-haired conductor kisses the top of her
head.  She flashes me a defiant look.  </p>

<p>“Does Sol know?” I ask Regina.  She
clears her throat.  “Naturally he knows,” she says. “She’s been carrying on for
years--don’t tell Mama.”  </p>

<p>Izzy dies; Tania dies.  Sol gives
Regina Tania’s diamond ring.  “I took it,” she tells me matter-of-factly. “He
gave it to me, so I took it.”  They’re in their seventies.  He takes her to the
opera; they eat in his apartment.  He can only digest baby food.  Mentioning
Sol’s apartment, a youthful, secretive look passes over her face.  She clears
her throat, looks at the ring.  “He wanted me to have it,” she says.  She seems
to enjoy tenderness with Sol, an easy affection.  I wonder if she calls it
love, if she calls it justice.  I wonder if they’ll marry.  Sol dies.</p>

<p>Regina is the only one left.  My neurotic aunt, the
beautiful one, died from spinal melanoma.  My mother, Gladys, had a stroke and
was cremated.  The youngest, the fat one, died from congestive heart failure
and donated her body to science, and that, Regina says emphatically, is worse
than cremation.</p>

<p><center>e</center></p>

<p>She slides around the kitchen in new black leather
slippers--two pairs for five dollars at Payless.  She’ll give away the blue
ones.  Four years already since Gladys died, and she still can’t take advantage
of a bargain just for herself.  </p>

<p>She tugs the fridge door, jingling
bottles of nail polish on the top shelf.  Takes out jam and cottage cheese,
puts a bagel in the toaster oven, makes instant coffee with milk.  Sits down
heavily, knees to the side.  The coffee is good.  She tears off a piece of hot
bagel and scoops up cottage cheese.  Her nails shine--iridescent white--her
friend’s daughter gave her a nice manicure.  </p>

<p>The phone rings.  She
jumps--ringing always makes her jump.  She pushes up from the table and hurries
to the foyer.  It’s a new phone with big buttons and an answering machine.  The
receiver weighs nothing.</p>

<p>A voice says, “Happy birthday,
Regina!”  A woman.  Sounds very familiar.  She hesitates.  Gets rescued.  “It’s
me--Sarah.”</p>

<p>She laughs--Gladys’s Sarah--of
course.  “The jacket fits perfect, darling,” she says, “but it’s a lousy time
for birthdays--I tell you--bombing in Afghanistan.  Oh--happy anniversary!  How
many years?”  </p>

<p>“Forty-four.  How are you
celebrating?” </p>

<p>She laughs.  “Friends are taking me
for lunch.  We preferred the movies but a surprise is coming.”  </p>

<p>“From whom?”   </p>

<p>Regina hesitates to say names on
the phone.  “The younger one,” she says, clearing her throat.  “A super-duper
surprise, at three o’clock.  Probably a big nothing.” </p>

<p>“What can he send on a Sunday?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I say.”</p>

<p>“Flowers?”</p>

<p>“No.  The older one is sending
flowers.  Well, we’ll see.”  She backs across the foyer and sits on the couch,
the cord stretched to the limit.  </p>

<p>“So you’re ninety,” Sarah says,
teasingly.  “Ninety going on sixteen.”</p>

<p>“Sure-sure, ninety, sixty,” Regina
laughs, “no difference except a bunion.”  </p>

<p>“You’re amazing,” Sarah says. 
“What’s up with Ben?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, he talks and talks,
but he doesn’t say anything.”  Ben’s plans either evaporate, she thinks, or
explode like bombs on innocent civilians.  “Yesterday he said the surprise is
coming three o’clock sharp--write it down.  I don’t need to write it down.”  </p>

<p>At eighteen months he got a
paring knife and slashed a kitchen chair seat.  At two he tried to lift the
fridge and had a hernia operation.  The hospital wouldn’t let her stay--it
still makes her cry, that she left without a fight.  She made it up to him. 
Bought him everything he wanted, defended his right to pee in his pants in
school.  He had allergies and terrible asthma.  And a mouth--oh, he had a mouth
on him--getting him to pipe down was a struggle.  He made her cry, and he made
her laugh--they danced--he was her little man, making her helpless with his
talk, making himself superior.  So cute, so jealous of her friends.  And a
terrific singer.  Things changed when she had a hysterectomy and wasn't
available.  She’d say, “Go ask your father,” and he'd say, “My father doesn't
know anything.”</p>

<p>Asthma kept him out of Vietnam.  He
organized antiwar protests in college, starred in <i>Fiddler on the Roof</i>,
imagined a Broadway career.  “Actors don’t have to be tall and handsome,”
Gladys said, “look at Dustin Hoffman.”  “Competing is too hard,” Regina said.
“What’s wrong with teaching?”  He took singing lessons, waited on tables.  He
moved in with an actress, a bossy redhead.  Reluctantly, Regina bragged her son
was a struggling actor--it sounded good, like struggling for justice and higher
wages.  But life was life, and she encouraged both sons to take the easy way.</p>

<p>Ben and his girlfriend got married
in city hall, nothing fancy.  He got more and more excitable, like Izzy’s crazy
brothers.  They bought a car and took trips.  Where did they get money for a
car and trips?  She didn’t like to mix in.  The first sentence they taught in
night school was “Mind your own business and let me mind mine”--that’s the
American way, the teacher said.  So she minded her own business.  Gladys mixed
in, of course, and got dirty looks.  They sent picture postcards from
California, from Mexico.  Then they got interested in Buddhism and announced
they were going to Thailand.  They couldn’t study Buddhism in New York?   Not
many postcards from Thailand.  They came back; they went away--came and went. 
Ben got very thin; she worried he didn’t eat.  And then they went away and
nothing.  No postcards.  No phone calls.  Three years they were gone; three
years he was gone.  Nothing.</p>

<p>One night two FBI men came to the
apartment without using the intercom.  They sat in the living room in their
dark suits and blank faces, demanding to know Ben’s whereabouts.  She and Izzy
didn’t know.  Terrible to feel dishonest while sticking to the truth, a dark
cloud spreading, like in the McCarthy days.  One interrogator said angrily,
“Who knows what goes on in those twisted minds of yours.”  That still bothers
her.  The men didn’t divulge a drop of information and likewise not a drop came
out of her and Izzy.  </p>

<p>The phone line was tapped--of
course--it went without saying.</p>

<p>The Weathermen
blew up a university lab in Wisconsin--she put her nose against the TV and
stared into the crowd.  He was underground--what else?--doing violence for
peace.  It made her sick.  She watched TV all day, all evening.  News, trash,
it didn’t matter.   </p>

<p>And gradually,
against her will, crime stories crept into her mind like viruses.  He could be
selling drugs, taking drugs, dealing with crooks.  Every mystery show seemed to
hold a personal message.  </p>

<p>Where was he?  She had a sick
feeling about him flickering out there, a speck of dust in the dark, and that
frightened her even more than imagining him in danger.  </p>

<p>The nights dragged; she couldn’t
eat.</p>

<p>Suspense, she read somewhere, some
quote, suspense is worse than despair.  Three years he was gone.  Three years. 
Not even a postcard.  </p>

<p>Izzy stopped joking and lost
interest in life.</p>

<p>The phone on the foyer bookcase
swelled whenever she passed it--an olive green phone with a stained dial, solid
as a pregnant belly, the extra-long coil tangled.  Ben floated outside the
line, along with his wife, the FBI, and strangers with bad news.  Her heart
jumped when it rang.  She picked up with dread and said hello with hope, or the
other way around.  </p>

<p>She and Izzy were eating pot roast
when he called.  “Hi, Mom,” he said cheerfully, “it’s me!”  Her heart stopped. 
He was in Canada, he said--he was great--he giggled--Canada was great, they
were both great.  He skipped through half sentences, or that’s all she heard
while waiting for justice, for love, her patience fraying in the violent blitz
of empty phrases and little laughs, static whirling in her head. </p>

<p>“You skunk!” she screamed.  “You
selfish good-for-nothing!”  Her first words.  Terrible.</p>

<p>He paid their way to Vancouver;
they met at baggage claim.  He wore sandals and baggy white clothes that looked
like pajamas.  Bleached blond hair hung in a pony tail.  He hugged her and
Izzy, crying a bit, talking too much.  His eyes were blank.  </p>

<p>“It was a voyage of discovery,” he
said, taking their suitcases.  “I know it caused you undeserved anxiety,” he
said evenly, “but I suffered too.  Life is unfair.”  </p>

<p>His new name was Adam Waterman.  No
more Ben Lasher.  He was Adam Waterman.</p>

<p>“Better you should have died,” she
said.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I deserve that,” he said.</p>

<p>“It would have been easier,” she
said.</p>

<p>Ben’s story left things out--just
as well.  She only knows they imported and sold--she can’t say it--heroin, and
when the FBI discovered their racket, they fled to Canada and changed their
names.</p>

<p>In her mind, though not on her
tongue, Adam is still Ben.  Did her grandsons ever ask why she has a different
last name?  They’re both grown--the big one is in medical school already--they
visit sometimes with their mother.  For a long time Ben didn’t leave Canada,
didn’t even see Izzy in his last years or attend his funeral.  Howie came,
naturally, and Gladys’s younger grandson, but not Ben.  She doesn’t hold a
grudge; what’s done is done--she’s not judgmental--but his plans, promises, and
secrets have made her more than a little suspicious.  He seems settled now, at
least on the surface, working for a public agency, helping drug addicts.  His
wife does some kind of social work that pays better.  They own a nice house,
grow flowers and vegetables in the backyard--and he’s publishing a self-help
book or publicizing it--she never knows what he means.  She doesn’t ask; she
doesn’t criticize out loud.  Criticism she left to Gladys; criticism was
Gladys’s department.  </p>

<p>Right and wrong is another matter;
morality goes up in smoke when the criminal is your own child.  Your mind
twists, you make excuses.  What if he’d gotten away with, not drug dealing, but
literally gotten away with murder?  Terrible, forcing a mother to face such
questions.</p>

<p>Eventually he arranged for her to
attend a session of EST.  She sat one whole day, not allowed to go to the
bathroom, and listened to leaders shout and shouted herself, and somehow when
the day was over, her feelings split, and she could accept Ben without having
to forgive him.  </p>

<p>Whenever the phone rings, a stale
flare-up of dread salted with hope shudders through her body.  </p>

<p>“Who’s taking you to lunch?” Sarah asks.</p>

<p>“Friends.  Esther will stay over.”</p>

<p>“Mama’s last birthday,” Sarah says
slowly, “I made her a chocolate cake.  Did I ever tell you what she wished
for?”</p>

<p>“She told?”</p>

<p>“World peace.”</p>

<p>“You see, it’s bad luck.”  Regina
sighs deeply.  “I miss her.”</p>

<p>“Me too.” </p>

<p>“So it goes.  Such a pain in the
neck, but I miss her.”</p>

<p>She hasn’t adjusted to Gladys being cremated.  Sarah and her
husband brought Gladys to Illinois after the stroke and expected to put her in
a local cemetery when the time came, even though her burial plot was paid up. 
Then Gladys dreamed she died, and in the dream she argued with herself.  On the
one hand, she argued, cremation is cheaper than being shipped back to
Brooklyn.  On the other hand burning is very painful, and pain is to be avoided
at all cost.  That’s what she told Sarah--imagine, taking a dream seriously. 
Sarah pointed out when you’re dead you don’t feel anything.  “In that case,”
Gladys said, “if the doctor is absolutely sure I’m dead, cremation is okay.”  </p>

<p>Economical to the end, even in her
sleep.</p>

<p>Naturally, Sarah discussed it with
her before taking action.  What could she say?  Dead is dead--worms, ashes,
what does it matter?  Still, she made Howie promise to put her next to Izzy no
matter what.  </p>



<p>“What kind of birthday presents did Izzy used to give you?”
Sarah asks.</p>

<p>Regina clears her throat.  “Izzy? 
Birthdays?  What are you talking about?  Maybe Stalin’s--he probably knew
Stalin’s birthday.”  </p>



<p>Ben had the nerve to hide behind Stalin.  “Hey, Pop,” he
laughed, “you taught us to defy the system, so I took it all the way.”  “What
kind of defy?” Izzy yelled. “Drugs are big business!”  “Listen to the
moralist,” Ben said, “the big shot.”  </p>

<p>Something broke in Izzy.  He gave
up the dinette business.  Didn’t shave and looked more and more like a monkey,
with a monkey’s smile.  He cut articles out of the<i> Daily Worker</i> and
stuffed them in his wallet.  Whoever they visited, right away he unfolded a
clipping and read it out loud till she shut him up.  He took clippings to the
park and tried to convert people to communism--old, young, English-speaking or
not.  Even in Waldbaum’s he stopped strangers in the aisles.  She hollered at
him.  She hollered at him their whole marriage for taking a joke too far. 
Although the big joke was on her.  She married him for his sense of humor, but
he laughed at everything. </p>

<p>By the time he
forgot Khrushchev’s denunciation of Stalin, he was not fit to visit anybody. 
She moved him to the spare room, where he watched television or lay in bed.  He
praised Stalin and hummed Red Army songs.  He asked questions and forgot the
answers.  Eventually he grew silent and thin, rooted in the apartment like a
strange-smelling plant.  She went out as usual but didn’t let anyone in, only
Gladys.  She learned the terrible word <i>Alzheimer’s</i> and said it
respectfully, like <i>cancer</i>.  </p>

<p>Eight years he
stayed cooped up except for solo migrations to Waldbaum’s when she was out. 
Like a homing pigeon, he went down the elevator, around the corner, across
Nostrand Avenue, through Waldbaum’s crowded aisles, and stole a loaf of Wonder
Bread.  How did she know?  The bread.  She’d come home from the beauty parlor,
peek at the kitchen table, and see the shiny red letters under red, yellow, and
blue balloons.  Or he sat hunched over a ripped package, mashing chunks in his
mouth.  No words.  “Why do you need to steal bread, Izzy?”  Neighbors saw him
in the elevator, in the street, even in winter.  She asked around, pieced it
together.  Once she saw him in the distance, a skinny old man in an overcoat,
pajamas, and slippers, shuffling across four lanes of traffic, cars stopping
for him.  She couldn’t take away his key; she didn’t have the heart.  Let him
have this bit of normalcy, all he was capable of, a man in his condition,
displaying a wonder of human nature, bringing home Wonder Bread.  She went to Waldbaum’s
manager and offered to pay.  “Sweetheart, you got enough trouble,” he said.
“Forget it.”  Sometimes, though, she hid his overcoat.  He wouldn’t leave the
house without his overcoat--even in summer he had to have his overcoat.  So
sometimes, not always, she hid it when she went out. </p>

<p>She bought baby food, made soup. 
She fed him.  She cleaned him.  He forgot how to sit, how to swallow.  But he
remembered her to the end.  When he died, <i>thank you</i> flew out of her
mouth.  And then she missed him.  After all, Izzy in the house was still Izzy
in the house.</p>



<p>“So where are they taking you?” Sarah asks.</p>

<p>She hesitates.  “I didn’t ask.”  </p>

<p>“Lundy’s?”</p>

<p>“The diner, maybe.  Didi likes the
diner.”  She clears her throat.</p>

<p>“Go to the Uzbek,” Sarah says.
“It’s your birthday.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, doll.  Bye.”</p>



<p>Regina makes a fresh cup of coffee and toasts a new bagel. 
Oh, boy, did Gladys yell at her for throwing away food--“You’re throwing away
money,” she’d say.  She clears newspapers off the coffee table and stuffs them
in the garbage.  Fills the candy dish and waters the plants.  Smiles at her
collection of dolls, so cute in their bright native costumes.  She loves their
sweet faces, each cuter than the next--it’s silly at her age to love dolls--but
so what?  She always brings back a doll when she travels.  She hates traveling,
or rather, she likes being someplace, but getting there is too much trouble.</p>

<p>She sweeps the kitchen.  Fifty
years in this building, a co-op now with a newly renovated lobby and intercom
and the same lousy elevator.  Gladys lived down the street.  She had the stroke
right here at the kitchen table, eating chicken soup, sliding off the chair,
her face drooping, soup pouring out of her mouth, begging in a strange gravelly
voice, “Give me soup--give me soup--give me chicken--give me compote.”  </p>

<p>A life together, eighty-six years. </p>

<p>Sarah once asked what made her so
different from her sisters, and she said Papa had a better attitude to her. 
When the first one was born, he went to his friends grumbling, “It’s a girl,
terrible, terrible.”  When the second was born he grumbled to his friends,
“It’s a girl, terrible, terrible.”  When she was born he laughed to his
friends, “I’m going to brag about this one.”  When the fourth was born, he
grumbled to his friends, “Another girl, terrible, terrible.” </p>

<p>Regina doesn’t remember who told
this story, but it stuck to her bones, Papa happy about her birth.  And to her
sisters’ bones, his disappointment.</p>

<p>She covers her hair carefully in
the shower--she had it done yesterday--nothing wrong with a progressive woman
going to the beauty parlor.  Puts on an African bead necklace and earrings
Sarah made.  Black pumps.  A little rouge, powder, and lipstick.  She’s short
and chunky, with thick white hair and small eyes.  Gladys was prettier, but
when they got old, strangers took them for twins.  Glaucoma, a bunion, and
sometimes a pain in her hip, but otherwise she feels good and avoids doctors. 
If something terrible happens, Howie and Sarah have her health care proxy,
specifying no artificial assistance or surgery.  </p>

<p>She has enough to live on--the few
savings she gave to Howie--what does she need savings for at her age?  She’s
laid back, but not in regard to politics; politics is not a matter for
complacency.  Capitalism stinks.  Too much wealth is concentrated in the hands
of a few, and workers have to struggle.  She doesn’t like to argue--everyone
has a right to their own opinion--but human nature, she sometimes says, is
still not ready for freedom.  </p>

<p>Naturally some of her close friends
are dead already--what can you expect?--but most, knock wood--she clears her
throat--most are alive and kicking and progressive.  The women coming today are
in their early eighties.  Esther, the artist, makes little sculptures, mainly
heads, out of self-hardening clay.  Pearl, the activist, American-born, sits on
the Coney Island Hospital citizens’ advisory board.  She drives an old Buick.</p>

<p>Didi, next-door, is a different
kettle of fish.  She’s from Czechoslovakia.  A gambler, a smoker, skinny.  Her
yellow hair is frizzy, her mouth twisted from a botched face lift, her voice
squeaky and hoarse.  She always wears makeup and laughs worse than Izzy.  They
go in and out of each other’s apartments at the drop of a hat and combine
supper leftovers.  Gladys used to complain she gave Didi supper too often and
Didi didn’t reciprocate--Gladys threw the word “reciprocate” like a hand
grenade.  True, Didi is manipulative, shallow, and insincere--Regina knows her
faults--but so what? She’s a good companion.  Once in a great while, Regina
accompanies her to Atlantic City for the day and loses forty dollars on slot
machines, not a penny more.</p>

<p>Her friends arrive about the same
time.  Didi hands her a box of chocolates, wrapped fancy.  She’s in her
turquoise velour jogging suit with matching eye shadow.  Esther brings a nice
plant.  Pearl, looking a mess, drops a tin of windmill cookies on the kitchen
table.  </p>

<p>“Tuck your blouse in,” Regina
says.  “It’s my birthday.”</p>

<p>“I’m double-parked,” Pearl says.</p>

<p>It’s so warm, they don’t need
coats.  Pearl drives them to the Uzbek, on the bay.  Dark red rugs hang on the
walls.  They take a table by the window.  Fishing boats bob at the dock;
families stroll across the bridge.  They share a peasant salad, stewed lamb,
chicken with vegetables, rice pilaf, and baklava. </p>

<p>Back in her kitchen they play May
I.  Didi wants to play for money, but she’s outvoted.  Howie calls from Miami. 
That sweet voice.  She tells him the truth, the florist hasn’t delivered
anything yet.  She makes instant coffee and serves the candy and cookies with
double-fudge chocolate-chip ice cream.</p>

<p>Such a gorgeous
day, the women say, so hot for November--if not for the surprise, they could
have gone to the Botanical Gardens.  What can Adam organize from Canada to
arrive on a Sunday afternoon?  Flowers?  Balloons?  They call him Adam, though
naturally they know him from before, when he was Ben.  They know he lives with
his head in the clouds, writing about himself and getting involved in doomed
money-making projects, like a special kind of retractable telephone cord.  They
like his wife.  She’s a very smart cookie, and their older son will be a foot
doctor.  The younger one is in college--such a cute boy, such a performer,
restless like his father, with the same allergies.  </p>

<p>They feel closer to Howie; he’s
easygoing, and Regina can rely on him.  Of course he lets his wife get away
with murder--a Bingo addict, selfish, gambling away every penny he earns.  He
handled departure gates for Pan Am--didn’t budge in forty years--and when Pan
Am folded, he got a job dealing cards in a casino--such a waste of
intelligence.  He’s too good by half--no wonder his sons lack ambition.  His
divorce finally came through--maybe she’ll move out now.  A shame his flowers
haven’t arrived.  Howie is sweet, but not lucky.</p>

<p>As for Adam, currently he’s waiting
for the universe to “manifest” him an Oprah interview.  He’s writing a book
about his life as a drug dealer, or he’s finished it, and the universe,
whatever that is, will help him get famous.  Famous!  Anyone with half a brain
knows exposure is dangerous.  Tell him forget the universe, they tell Regina.
Tell him leave well enough alone.  </p>

<p>But she can’t discourage him. 
Chasing dreams--that’s his way--he makes mistakes, gets anxious, has backaches
and asthma attacks, recovers, and sails into the clouds again, himself his own
hot-air balloon. </p>

<p>They adjourn to the living room,
where it’s cooler.  Regina feels nervous.  She doesn’t like to wait.  She likes
to get things over and done with.  </p>

<p>They talk about 9/11.  People are
out of work, and families don’t get enough help.  What’s happening to all the
millions in relief money?  Fattening rich pockets, no doubt about it.  And
what’s the government doing to reassure people?  Giving medicine.  Somebody
always profits from war.  The munitions manufacturers, naturally, and now the
big drug companies.  Anthrax drugs, smallpox vaccines.  </p>

<p>“Why always food and medicine right
away?” Regina asks. “The government always promises food and medicine.”</p>

<p>“To calm us down,” Pearl says
bluntly.  “But you notice they ask for blood donations first--that’s the
politics of sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“Naturally, everything is
politics.” </p>

<p>“And social control.”  Pearl gets
all worked up.  “They feed us stories about bombing Afghanistan to make us
secure and scared at the same time!  They jail innocent Muslims as a first step
in cutting civil liberties!  Since September 11, the government--”  </p>

<p>“Listen,” Didi breaks in, “since
9/11 everybody’s having accidents!  The maintenance man broke his leg.  That
nice bank teller cut her thumb slicing an onion.  A man in Florida was riding
fancy water skis and got killed by a duck!”</p>

<p>“A duck?” Pearl thunders.</p>

<p>“It flew right in his forehead.  I
saw it on the news.  Imagine that--feathers all over the whatchamacallit . . .
the handlebar.”</p>

<p>“Trouble spreads like anthrax
spores,” Esther says sadly.  “When people get unhappy they get careless, and
they hurt themselves . . .”  </p>

<p>The doorbell buzzes.  Regina gets
up.  Must be a neighbor.  She opens the door.  </p>

<p>A delivery man in a shiny black
jacket holds out a pizza box, smiling brightly.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Regina Lasher?”</p>

<p>“That’s me,” she says.   </p>

<p>“Happy birthday,” he announces. 
“Home delivery, thanks to”--he looks at the box--“uh, Adam Waterman.”</p>

<p>“The surprise is here!” Regina
calls over her shoulder.  “It’s a pizza!”  She feels letdown.  All that fuss
over a pizza?  </p>

<p>The delivery man brushes past her. 
“Wait a minute,” she says.  The box feels light and doesn’t smell--she peeks
in--it’s empty.  She drops it.  What’s going on?  The man is in the living
room, turning on a boom box that came from nowhere.  He’s dancing to pop music,
unzipping his jacket and moving his hips like John Travolta.  He’s pulling off
his T-shirt.  He unbuckles his belt.  </p>

<p>“Don’t strip!” she shouts, waving
her hands as if to stop a bus.  “Don’t strip!” </p>

<p>Not missing a beat, he buckles his
belt, looking at her, dancing sexy in tight jeans, his mouth open.  He’s very
handsome, very graceful, with spiky brown hair and sparkling eyes, his chest
naked.  He pulls Regina to him and bends her back and forth.  He dances with
Didi, with Esther, with Pearl.  She laughs; she can’t help laughing because
it’s so ridiculous, a male stripper in her living room dancing a fast foxtrot
with four old women, three of them seriously political--Gladys would turn in
her grave if she hadn’t been cremated.  He works the living room, turning it
into a dance hall where they all have partners.  Regina is a good dancer; she
loves to dance, mainly folk dancing, of course. He holds her close--she’s
embarrassed up against his bare skin--and her feet follow and the music
continues, and Esther and Pearl refuse his attentions so he partners just her
and Didi and finally just her, the birthday girl, ninety years old, flexed like
a doll, giving in and holding back (like Ginger Rogers), and then the music
stops.  He takes pictures of them with a disposable camera, flattering them,
working hard to make them smile.  Performance over, the room deflates.  He
quickly puts on his black T-shirt, tucks it in (she turns away), and zips up
his shiny jacket.  </p>

<p>“Boy, I had a hard time getting in
the building,” he says, picking up his boom box.  “That intercom’s a
mess--names here, apartment numbers there--I couldn’t figure out the damn
buttons.”  </p>

<p>Regina clears her throat.  “The new
system stinks,” she says.  “Management should have left the old one alone.” 
She walks him to the door.  </p>

<p>“Happy birthday, beautiful,” he
says, and kisses her on the mouth before she can turn her head.  She stands in
the doorway, watching him jog down the hall to the elevator.  On the mouth, oh
boy.  He’s fresh!</p>

<p>“Can you imagine what Adam spent on
that?” Pearl says.  Her face is red, and her whiskers bristle.  “I hate to
think.”</p>

<p>“He was disgusting,” Esther says.</p>

<p>“I’m not saying he wasn’t
disgusting,” Didi says, “but you gotta admit he was good looking.  A real
doll.”</p>

<p>“Adam spent an absolute fortune,”
Pearl insists.  “Which he doesn’t have.”</p>

<p>“So he spent a fortune,” Regina
says defensively.  “So he wanted to give me a laugh.  Better a joke than a
nervous breakdown.”</p>

<p>“A male stripper,” Pearl says. 
“For old ladies.  Where do people get such ideas?”</p>

<p>Regina clears her throat.  “Look,
he wanted so badly to do something special for me and this is what he came up
with.  A male stripper.  Is it so terrible?  I bet some women in the senior
center would even let him undress.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Didi says, “why not?  I
haven’t had a good look in I don’t know how many years.”</p>

<p>“So okay,” Regina says, “pipe
down.  I’m calling him now.  He must be on pins and needles.”</p>

<p>She dials Vancouver.  Such a cute
baby he was, running around naked, daring her to dress him.  </p>

<p>He picks up after one ring.  “Happy
birthday, Mom,” he says excitedly.  “So tell me, how was the performance?”  </p>

<p>“I certainly was surprised, I’ll
tell you that,” she says.  “It was really something.  Thank you, darling.”  She
clears her throat.  She can’t help thinking Pearl’s right; he could have bought
something useful with all that money.  Did his wife approve?  Probably not. 
“Of course I didn’t let him strip.”</p>

<p>“There was not supposed to be a
strip,” Ben says anxiously.  “I instructed them--there were explicit
instructions.  No stripping, just dancing.  And taking pictures.  That was the
deal.”</p>

<p>“I see.”  She clears her throat. 
“Well, he got started, and then I hollered at him not to strip--he was very
handsome and oh boy, what a good dancer.”</p>

<p>“How long was the performance?” Ben
asks.</p>

<p>“About fifteen minutes.”</p>

<p>“Fifteen minutes?” Ben shrieks. 
“The swindling bastards!  I paid for half an hour!”</p>

<p>“Pipe down, he had a hard time
getting in the building.”</p>

<p>“Whaddya mean hard time?  I told
them the buttons are lined up by apartment number!”</p>

<p>“The intercom system got changed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shit, Mom.  I wanted this to
be perfect.”</p>

<p>“It was perfect, it was perfect,
believe you me.  He danced, he took pictures.  We all danced.  Didi, Pearl,
Esther.  I’ll remember this birthday forever.  It was perfect.  What more can
you ask?  I had a good laugh.”</p>
